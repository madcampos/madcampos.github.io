me enlighten you, grasshopper. Fallout 2 is cool because it's a nonlinear, non class based kick-ass postnuclear computer roleplaying game with a high replayabillity value. Fallout 2 allows you to play your character the way you want. If you want to play a goodie-two-shoes, you can. If you want to play an evil bastard, you can (Yes, you really can hit children in the groin with a sledgehammer). If you want to play a moron who can hardly talk because of his low intelligence, you can.</p><footer><cite>Shadowman</cite></footer></blockquote></header><hr><article><h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a class="header-link" href="#introduction">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>Hey, stranger! Need a guide?</p><footer><cite>New Reno prostitute</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Welcome to my <em>Fallout 2</em> guide/walkthrough. This guide exists because I realized that if I wanted the kind of complete <em>Fallout 2</em> guide that I envisioned, it pretty much meant writing it myself. That turned out to be quite an undertaking, but on the other hand, as far as I'm concerned <em>Fallout 2</em> is the best computer game ever made.</p><p>This guide is an attempt to provide a thorough presentation of the things you can do in <em>Fallout 2</em>: quests to perform, places to go, people to eat. It is not, on the other hand, an attempt to compile reams of game data such as documenting every karma point gained or lost, because it wouldn't be much fun. For game mechanics, detailed item stats and such, consult the manual and/or available in-game information. The basic assumption is that players want to squeeze as much out of their game as possible - which is another thing that makes writing this guide worthwhile, because <em>Fallout 2</em> is a game that just keeps on giving. There are details and aspects you won't notice until your second, third or fourth game, playing different characters with different attitudes. Or until you read this guide, anyway.</p><p>I've been playing the game using the UK edition, patch version 1.02e plus the "children patch". To my knowledge there is not a single significant difference between the UK and US versions except for the children thing. I've also used <em>Falche2 Character Editor 2.10</em> and Inventory Editor 1.01 extensively to try out situations and features; moreover I've used <em>Fallout 2 DAT explorer v1.42</em> to unpack game files, <em>Fallout Items Mode Editor 1.1</em> to check out some item details, <em>Fallout Utility for Critter tinKering 0.62</em> to check out some critter data, and the script decompilers by TeamX and Noid as well as the scripts that came with the <em>Fallout 2</em> Mapper to check lots of things. Since trainers, utilities and mods aren't part of the game, I won't deal with them specifically. I don't recommend cheating, other than momentarily for the purpose of experiencing things that you wouldn't normally see, or in a last-ditch attempt to save a doomed character.</p><p>Virtually every piece of information or advice presented here has been verified in personal testing or playing experience, although I have of course consulted rather a lot of existing walkthroughs and board postings for snippets of information and things to try out. Sadly, many guides are either poorly written (<cite>"klammth this place stinks btr get sum quest!!! i need the xp!!!!!"</cite>), give embarrassingly bad advice ("So that's why I always tag Throwing, First Aid and Barter"), include patently false information ("If you keep the Pipe Gun in one of your active item slots it will give you Agility +3, it doesn't work for all characters"), or are glaringly incomplete ("I've heard there is a place called New Reno in this game but I never found it"). Hopefully this guide should avoid those pitfalls with some margin to spare.</p><p>Of other <em>Fallout 2</em> writings I would recommend those of <em>Whitechocobo666</em>, author of the <em>Endings FAQ</em>, the <em>Perks FAQ</em>, the <em>Weapon/armor FAQ</em> and the <em>Evil Walk-through</em>; Steve Metzler, whose <em>Steve's Guide to Fallout 2</em> was my original source of inspiration; <em>Chris Avellone</em>, co-designer of the game and maker of the <em>Fallout Bible</em>; and also <em>Cristian Golumbovici</em>. General credit goes to the people on the No Mutants Allowed message board. Special thanks to <em>Sébastien Caisse</em> a.k.a. <em>Red!</em> for checking scripts and stuff for guide version 1.0.</p><p>Please note that <strong>spoilers abound</strong>. The first time you play a game like this, you really shouldn't be using any kind of walkthrough whatsoever. If you don't care enough about the unique experience of finding out and doing things on your own to abstain from spoiling it, you probably have better things to do with your time than play the game at all. So, in case this is your first game, don't read beyond Preparations.</p><p>If you have a gameplay or technical question that doesn't have anything to do with the guide itself (unless it hints at a deficiency therein), please turn to a message board; there are several on the net. I'm sorry, but you must understand that I'm not a one-person helpline. At least do a couple of string searches before you decide the answer isn't in the guide already.</p><p>Comments and additional information have been color-coded in the following imaginative manner:</p><aside class="green"><p>A green section marks straightforward, reliable information or advice.</p></aside><aside class="yellow"><p>A yellow section signals some measure of uncertainty or speculation, but information given can be expected to be correct in broad terms.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>A red section is used for highly speculative information as well as massively peripheral or trivial comments.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>A blue section is used for general comments appearing in the Area walkthrough section which have a wider application than the specific context where they are brought up, such as character design, combat strategy or general game behavior.</p></aside><aside class="rp"><p>A purple section is used to mark content added by Restoration Project.</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="preparations">Preparations <a class="header-link" href="#preparations">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>I'll get you during my next save game.</p><footer><cite>The Chosen One</cite></footer></blockquote><p>First of all you should find out if you need to patch your game. Originally this game existed in five different versions: the US edition, two UK editions (normal and low violence), and two localized editions in German and French respectively. Before playing you should locate, download and install the patch (v1.02) for your version, since this will <em>drastically</em> improve performance and gameplay from the unpatched version of the game. This is all in the readme file, by the way. Always read those. In the walkthrough, notes that are only relevant to the unpatched game will be marked with red stars, i.e., as being largely uninteresting. If you have any kind of budget re-release or new localized version I don't think there should be any need to patch the game, but for your own sake you should make sure.</p><aside class="green"><p>Install the patch before you start playing, since saves made in the unpatched game will be invalidated. There is an unofficial save game converter, but I think it only works on US saves and not on any of the European versions.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can use the US executable with the UK version if you are bothered by the CD lock of the latter. To my knowledge there are no harmful consequences to this. As an aside, there are a few known purely textual differences between the US and UK versions concerning "sensitive" words: "drug" has become "chem", and "addiction" has become "reliance" (but the "Addict" tab in the main interface is still the same). The reason why is anyone's guess, but if you've been wondering where I got this "chem" word from, that's the explanation.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>There is no official patch for the English Low Violence edition (marked ELV on the CD), but it's been reported that using either the US or UK patch works fine, even though it says in the readme that "applying a patch from any of the other versions will severely corrupt the game". You might want to go for the US patch, because of the CD lock thing. (Actually what I'd really recommend is not having anything to do with that product in the first place.)</p></aside><p>I also strongly recommend, if you have any other version than the US one, that you download the so-called children patch. This set of files, which is not technically a patch at all, will add the in-game children which have been removed from these versions (for some obscure reason of law or policy which apparently did not apply at all to <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, where you can roast kids with Fireballs all you want). You don't need any additional code, it's all there already. If you don't have the kid files, you'll miss out on a few quests, be exposed to invisible pilferers and be confounded by bodiless voices, which is all bad. You have been warned.</p><aside class="green"><p>The contents of the children patch are simply the kid graphics files which have been copied raw from the US CD, and what's been done to the UK version to remove the kids is simply keeping those same files off the CD. Interestingly enough, Interplay's customer support used to deny all this, but I suppose that would have to be their official line.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A somewhat edited <em>Ashmo</em>: "The German version has no kids and only the 'low violence' deaths. People drop dead. If you set it to normal violence rather than none, they drop dead and bleed. The preferences screen is a bit different as there are only two options on the violence control. You need to get the gore patch (which usually includes the children patch) and then edit the config file to set the violence level higher (setting it to 3 should do the trick). The alternative is to get the executable from the US or UK version and overwrite yours."</p></aside><p>Saving and loading times in the unpatched version can be as long as a minute or more. There are at least three ways of improving this to an acceptable 3-10 seconds:</p><ol><li>Install the patch!</li><li>Use the large installation size instead of the humongous. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it works that way on many computers.</li><li>Shut down or disable programs running in the background, such as virus scanners.</li></ol><aside class="red"><p>I have also found on my own computer that Windows instability has at times caused a significant increase to loading times and that restarting the computer takes care of this. Your system may have its own peculiarities. On fast computers loading times may not be an issue at all, but there are always other problems that crop up to compensate.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>One potential problem that relates to processor speed concerns world map travel. On some fast computers, you will zip across the map and have virtually no encounters. Conversely, on computers that can barely run the game you might experience slow travel with numerous interruptions (though this should be a less frequent issue). There are hacks you can use to restore travel speed to a more reasonable level, or you could try running an emulator.</p></aside><p>Save often! Ideally you should quick-save after every battle and before every conversation. Having to play even a few minutes' worth of shootin' and lootin' all over again because you made the wrong choice in a dialogue can be irksome. (Of course it may also happen that you realize only afterwards that you've done something wrong and wish you had <em>not</em> saved...) I'd also recommend keeping a save game slot for each time you enter a new major location (town, etc.). This way if you really screw up somehow and only find out after you save (it can happen), you "only" have to replay that area. These saves can also come in handy later on if you want to see what would have happened if you'd done differently in a particular quest.</p><aside class="green"><p>A little word of warning about quick-save: as you probably know the quick-save function is "reset" when you use the regular load or save commands. However, it's not reset if you exit the current game and start a new character.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Once you fill up your quota of slots you can use a file manager of your choice to make room for new ones. Just rename a save game folder (those named "<samp>Slot01</samp>" through "<samp>Slot10</samp>") you don't need for the moment to something which gives you a hint of what it contains (like "<samp>Slot02-klam</samp>"), and that slot will be free for use again. Then whenever you want to bring back an archived save, restore that folder's name to a valid one. You can use a similar trick to swap between whole save catalogues by renaming the "<samp>Savegame</samp>" folder to "<samp>SavegameX</samp>" or something else. This way you can juggle different games with different characters.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A more "realistic" approach to the game involves using a single save slot and reloading only if you die or screw up entirely by mistake (but not, for instance, if you fail some action or have second thoughts about something). Not recommended at all for beginners. Also better use at least one more slot for backup just in case your save files are corrupted. An even more realistic playing style called "iron man" involves never saving the game <em>at all</em> except between playing sessions; if you die, you're dead and have to start all over again! (Though I suspect that very few people have actually stuck with this concept to the bitter end, for instance after dying in NCR because you forgot to holster your weapons or in a freak random encounter with super mutants.)</p></aside><p>Entering the options screen (which can also be reached from within the game, of course, the difference being that these settings will be used in new games but do not affect existing ones, while changes made in saved games will carry over to this screen), I'd change the following default settings: combat speed to fastest (check the box), target highlight to "on" (helps you see what's happening to critters behind walls), and running to "always". If you've played through the game a few times already you may want to consider raising the difficulty levels too hard/rough.</p><aside class="red"><p>If you hold down Shift and press the credits button on the starting screen, you'll get to read a quote file from the developers. Good for a laugh!</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>You can access some sort of recording mode if you press <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> on the starting screen. You get to choose an area and run around it (with Narg), but you can't talk to people (unless you set off some script) or manipulate objects except for opening doors. This also creates a "<samp>selfrun</samp>" directory in your game folder where the recording is stored. When you're fed up, press <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> again to return to the starting menu. If you now wait for a while, one of your recordings will start playing, more or less accurately. The most interesting thing about this is that it shows a few unimplemented or unreachable areas, namely the Holy Hand Grenade encounter (see the Addenda section for more on this), a third Den area (with Smitty and Anna in it), and the inside of the space shuttle (which doesn't have any proper graphics). See the Area walkthrough section for a way to exploit this in the game.</p></aside><p>There's a particular bug I want to tell you about right away, the "too many items" bug, because when it strikes you won't necessarily have any clue what causes it (unless you read this, that is). In brief, if you collect too many items (e.g., if you aim at hoarding every quest item in the game in the trunk), this will corrupt save files and make the game crash. Normally you shouldn't need to worry, but if you spot the skilldex button going black while you're playing, you're in the danger zone. See Addenda for more info and a way to counter this bug if the worst comes to the worst.</p></article><hr><article><h2 id="character-design">Character design <a class="header-link" href="#character-design">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>You'd think there's only ten kinds of people in the world. Way I figure it, there was some big cloning accident in the past.</p><footer><cite>Mason</cite></footer></blockquote><p>The SPECIAL system used for <em>Fallout 2</em> character design is so flexible that a complete run-down on possible types isn't feasible nor desirable. I'll center this discussion on a character type which has worked very well for me and try to argue briefly why it does. If the four extremes of character creation are the ones known as diplomat, thief, sniper and brawler, mine is a kind of small guns generalist who can in time excel at everything. It is somewhat similar to the one popularly known as "diplosniper", although some details such as my liking of Fast Shot may run counter to that definition. In any case you'll gain a lot more xp than in <em>Fallout</em>, which is why there's really no need to choose a specific path.</p><aside class="green"><p>The pre-defined characters are generally considered to suck dead gophers (e.g., Narg has Throwing, Mingan has Skilled and Chitsa has Barter). One of the nicest things about most computer RPGs is creating your own character or characters, anyway; even if I wanted a "Mingan" character, I'd make one instead of taking Mingan.</p></aside><p>Gender plays a negligible role in the game. Bartering is only affected if you also have the Sex Appeal trait. The only noteworthy differences are that male characters can donate genetic material in Vault City and date Phyllis, while female characters can sleep with Metzger, Little Jesus and T-Ray for money or favors and can get hired by Miss Kitty to go to the Stables. There are several more people that will only sleep with characters of a specific gender (e.g., Angela Bishop, Slim Picket, Fannie Mae), but not much comes of it. Stupid characters can only box if they're male.</p><aside class="green"><p>Age is not checked in any of the scripts. A nice detail is that your character will age as time goes by in the game (well, maybe the opposite would have been strange, but it's nice anyway, isn't it?).</p></aside><h3 id="character-design--stats">Stats <a class="header-link" href="#character-design--stats">🔗</a></h3><p>When allotting char points there are some things to keep in mind:</p><dl><dt>Strength</dt><dd>Extremely useful for... carrying stuff. Believe me, this is a game in which you'll want to carry stuff. You should start out with at least 5 (especially if you're taking Small Frame). However, since ST can be increased by 6 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1, armor +4), I wouldn't recommend going any higher than that; even if you go for the full 10 it will mostly be noticeable in the beginning stages of the game (and a waste towards the end).</dd><dt>Perception</dt><dd>Good for ranged combat. A starting minimum of 5 is required for the Awareness perk, but there are quest benefits to setting it to 6 even for HtH characters. Can be increased by 2 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1).</dd><dt>Endurance</dt><dd>Determines Hit Points and not much else. Unless you like close combat a little too much I wouldn't put more than 4 (and anyway, two extra points to EN still only means some 30 extra HP by the end of the game). Can be increased by only 1 point during the game (perk +1).</dd><dt>Charisma</dt><dd>Useful for keeping your dialogue options open, though not nearly so important as Intelligence. Affects bartering both directly and indirectly. Your maximum number of followers is equal to your CH divided by two, rounded down. Even if you don't plan to keep any company you might want to set it to 2 so you can at least pick up NPCs temporarily for xp and such. Can be increased by 3 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1, shades +1).</dd><dt>Intelligence</dt><dd>Unless you plan to rely on brute force for everything, this is likely your most important statistic since it rules conversation and determines extra skill points per level. 7 is a balanced value since it means you only need one Mentats for the few occasions where you need to go higher, though anything up to and including 9 is probably not too much. Can be increased by 3 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1, weird brain alignment +1).</dd><dt>Agility</dt><dd>Determines your Action Points, so you don't want less than 6, and starting with anything up to 10 doesn't hurt. Can be increased by only 1 point during the game (perk +1).</dd><dt>Luck</dt><dd>As the effects of Luck are not so obvious, it's easy to perceive it as the trash stat of the system (much like Charisma usually is everywhere else). It does have an impact on your rate of critical hits, especially with the Sniper perk in place, but early in the game you won't suffer much from a low Luck score. It can be improved by 3 points during the game (perk +1, either a weird brain alignment +2 or another weird brain alignment +1).</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>Stats can never be effectively raised above 10. Of those stat rises mentioned above, the "weird alignment" which gives IN +1 and LK +1 and the other which gives LK +2 are mutually exclusive. Also evil characters will normally lose out on the "surgery" IN +1 bonus.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A Strength of 5 is enough to handle virtually all weapons early on and many later ones as well (HK P90c, Gauss Pistol, Pulse Rifle). ST 6 is needed for some mid- or late-game weapons such as the Gauss Rifle and Bozar, and ST 7 for all kinds of miniguns, which means that once you get the Power Armor you can pick and choose anyway. If you use a Bozar with ST 5 you "only" get a -20% penalty which can be balanced with skill points, whereas the stat point can be put to better use.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>EN, CH and AG all work in the way that an odd score will not give you any significant advantages compared to the even number below, e.g., AG 6 or 7 both give you 8 Action Points. Keep this in mind, but also keep in mind ways of increasing stats later; with an odd starting AG, the Gain Agility perk becomes an extra Action Boy, which it wouldn't otherwise.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>As listed in the patch notes, the correct amount of extra HP per level is EN/2+2 (rounded down).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can eat Mentats and recruit party members while your CH is high; you won't lose them when your CH returns to normal (except in the rare case of CH 1 and <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>). Note however that this will only let you raise your CH by 2, which corresponds to one extra NPC (unless you use the save/load trick - see the Items section). Although there are other ways to improve your CH, in my opinion the best NPCs are the ones found early in the game anyway.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0, getting the <a href="#car">Car</a> would effectively raise your maximum number of NPCs by one, so that under optimal conditions you could have six of them. The readme mentions this has been fixed for <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, but actually all of them had the same problem and the same fix.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you set IN lower than 4, your character will (usually) only be able to speak in grunts, unable to carry on any meaningful dialogue. Needless to say this will severely impair your ability to take on and solve quests, but you can use Mentats to help with that. (Note that you can also use Mentats "in reverse" during a normal game - take one or two and wait one hour for your stats to drop below normal - if you want to take advantage of an IN&lt;4 feature. Psycho is even more effective.) For more details, see the Stupid section.</p></aside><h3 id="character-design--traits">Traits <a class="header-link" href="#character-design--traits">🔗</a></h3><p>Recommended traits:</p><dl><dt>Small Frame</dt><dd>One more stat point and not "some Action Points" like the manual says. Carrying stuff is nice (mmm... stuff), but not crucial once you learn what to keep and what to stow away.</dd><dt>One Hander</dt><dd>Many of the best weapons in the game are two-handed, but it's good for HtH characters since the bonus applies for Unarmed-class weaponry, none of which is two-handed (your completely unaided punch and kick attacks are unaffected).</dd><dt>Finesse</dt><dd>Decent trade-off. Like the More Criticals perk this is made obsolete by the Sniper (with high LK) or Slayer perks, but Finesse will benefit you from the very start of the game.</dd><dt>Fast Shot</dt><dd>A personal favorite, because I like firing a pistol five or six times during a round. When you get Sniper, it rocks, and sticking to burst weapons makes the drawback irrelevant. Don't take this if you're a hard-core sniper though.</dd><dt>Gifted</dt><dd>The stat bonuses counteract the skill penalties (especially if you put a few extra points to IN), so this is universally regarded as the best trait. I don't use it myself because it almost feels like cheating, or at the very least it spoils the challenge of balancing your stats.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>Geoffrey Bateman opines on Small Frame (which I originally rated as a poor trait): "You lose a little Carry Weight, but you'll get <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> soon, and then maybe a couple more mules, then a <a href="#car">Car</a>, and Power Armor... Small Frame makes the game a <em>little</em> tougher for a <em>brief</em> while, and in return you get a character point (which could be used for, say, an extra point of IN and 2 skill points per level)."</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Fast Shot doesn't work with HtH attacks, but still removes your ability to make targeted blows (meaning it's actively bad for melee characters). This is a change from <em>Fallout</em>.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you raise a stat with Bruiser, Small Frame or Gifted, you can redistribute the extra point(s) manually, so think of them as extra generic char points, although technically this is not so (which is reflected by the fact that you can't lower the raised stats below certain values, but that should never be a problem).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Paul Melin points out that if you were going to set IN to 10 anyway, the skill point loss from Gifted cannot be offset. Sure, but how many skill points can you find a use for anyway?</p></aside><p>Potentially useful but not overly worthwhile traits:</p><dl><dt>Heavy Handed</dt><dd>Helpful early on, but downright awful late in the game when you'll actually do less damage than if you didn't have this trait.</dd><dt>Jinxed</dt><dd>Could be useful in a pure (and weird) HtH game. If you or your party members are using guns yourself you shouldn't want to randomize combat unless you're always worse at it than the critters you'll be fighting (in which case you may want to rethink your playing style entirely).</dd><dt>Good Natured</dt><dd>Effectively a skill point boost, since you gain more useful points (Doctor, Speech) than you lose useful ones (Small Guns or Melee Weapons), but marginal in the long run. Unmissable in a pure diplomat game, if you get around to playing one of those.</dd><dt>Sex Appeal</dt><dd>Admit it, you always wanted this.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>Sex Appeal is mostly for female characters, since you'll be dealing with more men in the game world. Even so it won't be an important factor. If you have a low CH it will have a noticeable effect on bartering (almost all shopkeepers are male). It has no positive effect if your CH is 10, and no negative effect if your CH is 1.</p></aside><p>Traits to avoid:</p><dl><dt>Fast Metabolism</dt><dd>Both effects are utterly marginal, so it's simply an utterly marginal trait.</dd><dt>Bruiser</dt><dd>Two more stat points, but you need the AP. That's like losing four points of Agility, which is ridiculous.</dd><dt>Kamikaze</dt><dd>Trade away protection for Sequence which matters only during the first combat round? No thanks.</dd><dt>Bloody Mess</dt><dd>Fun to begin with (for instance, start up a game and beat up Klint), but doesn't do anything in game terms, and gets tiresome. You'll see those animations anyway and it will feel more like a reward without this trait.</dd><dt>Skilled</dt><dd>With a decent IN you'll be swimming in skill points. A horrible trait, avoid like the plague (unless you have IN 1 or something, though it beats me why you would).</dd><dt>Chem Reliant</dt><dd>The average time you spend being addicted won't change, so what's the big deal? Chem use is marginal anyway and most players will probably just reload if they get addicted.</dd><dt>Chem Resistant</dt><dd>Jet is the only chem with a short enough duration that the downside matters much, but even so it's little more than a convenience (you don't have to reload as often).</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>Jon Lynch makes an interesting argument: "The Skilled trait is not as bad as it seems. Every 12 levels, someone with this trait will fall exactly one perk behind. However, they will also have accumulated 60 more skill points in this time. Since most perks that add skill points tend to give 20-40 of them, you're getting approximately double the points and they can also be placed in any skill, whereas the perks allocate the points for you." Still, this assumes you were going to get a skill point perk, which usually isn't your greatest priority. At level 24 I'd much rather have two more perks than 120 extra skill points.</p></aside><h3 id="character-design--skills">Skills <a class="header-link" href="#character-design--skills">🔗</a></h3><p>Recommended skills to tag:</p><dl><dt>Small Guns</dt><dd>Because you should be using this for your primary combat skill for most of the game.</dd><dt>Lockpick</dt><dd>Because there are many, many locked containers and doors and you'll want to open them with a minimum of fuss.</dd><dt>Speech</dt><dd>Because you want people to like you and be impressed with you and give you quests and generally do what you tell them to.</dd></dl><p>There simply isn't any other skill which comes close to the usefulness of these three, at least if you're playing the game my way. Tag them and bump them up to around 100% early on (except possibly Small Guns if you want more use out of those Guns and Bullets magazines), it will pay off. A melee character will want one of these instead of Small Guns:</p><dl><dt>Melee Weapons</dt><dd>Unless you make this your primary combat skill you never really have to use it. If you do, tag it and pump it to 100% as soon as possible.</dd><dt>Unarmed</dt><dd>This is used in a few quests, but you don't have to spend any skill points here since it can be raised for free to about 100% anyway. Unless you're going Unarmed all the way I'd wait till after that to make it my primary combat skill.</dd></dl><p>With that taken care of you can start raising your secondary skills:</p><dl><dt>Big Guns</dt><dd>Fun, but only used late in the game and so not worth a tag.</dd><dt>Energy Weapons</dt><dd>See Big Guns.</dd><dt>Doctor</dt><dd>You'll want this up to 75% eventually, but not worth a tag.</dd><dt>Traps</dt><dd>There aren't that many traps in the game, actually, and they're not likely to kill you. You could raise it to 60-70% for convenience, but feel free to ignore this skill altogether.</dd><dt>Science</dt><dd>Can be raised with books. You'll want at least 81% eventually, but don't use any points until you have to.</dd></dl><p>Skills you will use but need not spend points on:</p><dl><dt>First Aid</dt><dd>Does little that Doctor doesn't do better. Don't use any skill points on this, raise it with books.</dd><dt>Repair</dt><dd>Can be raised with books, so don't use points here.</dd><dt>Outdoorsman</dt><dd>Can be raised with books, although those are rare. Mostly good for avoiding annoying random encounters.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>If you've been wondering what First Aid <em>does</em> do better than Doctor, it comes with a free +20% bonus to your skill check. And... that's pretty much it, I think.</p></aside><p>Rather pointless skills:</p><dl><dt>Throwing</dt><dd>Rocks and grenades simply don't play a huge role in the world of <em>Fallout 2</em>.</dd><dt>Sneak</dt><dd>I'm sorry, but I don't see the point of sneaking past people when you can just blow them up instead (or maybe that's the point, you sneak up and plant dynamite? Unfortunately there's not enough dynamite to employ this tactic consistently).</dd><dt>Steal</dt><dd>Don't bother unless either you don't mind if everyone turns hostile on you, or you plan to save and reload a lot (which isn't my favored playing style). If you really must steal something, you can usually do it with a low skill level (saving first, of course).</dd><dt>Barter</dt><dd>Early in the game there won't be a whole lot to buy. Later in the game you'll be swimming in money. Don't waste a single skill point here. Unless you raise the skill way above 100% your CH will have a greater impact on bartering anyway.</dd><dt>Gambling</dt><dd>See Barter.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>Your amount of unspent skill points is capped at 99 when you level up. You can have more than 99 points stored (e.g., after getting a skill point perk), but only until you level up next time.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A "cheat": when buying a non-combat skill which is slightly above 100%, raise the difficulty to hard (assuming you usually play on normal). Your skill will drop below 100% so you only have to spend one skill point per skill level. Afterwards return the difficulty setting to normal or whatever. This also works when reading books; see the Items section for a note on this.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Similarly you can set the difficulty to easy to raise your skills temporarily for a specific action (again assuming you're playing on normal or hard).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Some players actually favor the Sneak skill as in some situations it will let you kill people without anyone noticing, which is useful in assassinations. It can also be useful for HtH characters to get as close to the enemy as possible before they open fire. It doesn't much help with stealing, though, as in almost every shop where the wares are kept in an onscreen container the script simply doesn't take sneaking into account.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>I'll put a couple of Steal notes here, because they don't seem to fit anywhere else. You gain a bonus (or suffer a smaller penalty) stealing from the back or side of someone, but the Sneak skill does nothing. Item size (which is not the same as weight) is a factor unless you have the Pickpocket perk. Regardless of your skill level you can use Steal to see what humanoid critters are carrying, although you won't see items they're holding or items that they "produce" during the course of a quest.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you manage to steal and/or plant an item two or more times in succession you gain an increasing amount of xp for each successful attempt: 10, 20, 30 and so on, meaning the total will be 10, 30, 60 and so on. However, the total amount will cap out at 300 minus your Steal level, and if you're caught you get none at all. Low-level thief characters can benefit from this by stealing "one coin at a time" from potential victims (or swapping an item back and forth). Personally I'd try to think of something more meaningful to do.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>In some shops you can use Steal on the shopkeeper or a container to take stuff and/or money; in others you can't because the wares are kept in an offscreen container when you're not talking to the shopkeeper or because some scripting feature prevents it. In the latter case wares will appear on the body of the shopkeeper only if you kill them, and perhaps not even then.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p><em>Starseeker</em> adds this on Steal: "I have found out that if you have low Lockpick skills, you can try to steal stuff from locked drawers or tables, but it may not always work for some reason. It won't work on lockers." Experimentation shows that it works on desks and workbenches, but not on lockers or footlockers.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can plant items on people using Steal. The only use of this feature I know of, except giving equipment to your NPCs, is to arm an explosive, put it on someone, then whistle innocently and walk away a bit. But don't save your game before it goes off; it's been reported that this can corrupt your save slot completely!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A tip from <em>Masklinn</em>: "Some people don't show their weapons (sometimes other items, but mainly weapons) in the thieving interface but accept to barter them. Just enter the barter interface, put the weapon in the trading area, then go back and quit dialogue; quite a lot of people will have put the item where you can see it in the thieving interface and you can now steal it."</p></aside><p>As a rule, it's not worth it to raise most skills above 101%. Combat skills can be improved beyond that for an extra edge until you reach the point where you get the maximum 95% chance to hit against all opponents and from any reasonable range (which takes a bit longer if you practice the art of aimed shots or blows). Unarmed is an exception if you make use of the HtH Evade perk, though at high levels you'll have to spend quite a lot of skill points for each point of AC. Science has a few uses above 101%; most are strictly marginal, but go for it if you don't have anything else to do with the points. Most often you can just try again if you fail a skill check, even in dialogue. Sneak, Steal and Outdoorsman might seem like exceptions since failure has more of an immediate effect in these cases, but your rate of success hardly rises linearly with skill level anyway; quite likely the chance of success for Steal and Sneak is capped at 95% even before modifiers are applied, just like Outdoorsman.</p><h3 id="character-design--perks">Perks <a class="header-link" href="#character-design--perks">🔗</a></h3><p>The three top perks, hands down:</p><dl><dt>Awareness</dt><dd>Extremely useful. This should be your first perk (which means you should always start with a minimum PE of 5).</dd><dt>Bonus Rate of Fire</dt><dd>In conjunction with Fast Shot this is so good.</dd><dt>Sniper</dt><dd><em>The</em> sniper perk which will allow you to take on opponents like the Navarro and Enclave troops confidently.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>In case you need to raise a stat with a perk in order to qualify for another perk, make sure you get this in time. Ideally you should have a good idea when you start playing which perks to take at which level. If you don't have the stats to meet the requirements of a perk you can in some cases use drugs to raise them temporarily and get the perk, but this does not work with perks that have a Luck requirement, for instance. Check out the chems in the Items section for details. Also remember you must spend each perk before earning a new one.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Some have asked me about Sniper and how it interacts with effects that modify your Critical Chance; specifically, the observation has been made that "Sniper and non-aimed" can produce less criticals than "aimed and non-Sniper". Basically this is correct for values of Luck below 6. How I think Sniper works, and which is borne out by shooting the pariah dog a great number of times, is that it doesn't replace your usual critical chance but instead adds an independent possibility of a critical hit. If you have Luck 4 you'd normally get criticals 4% of the time, with Sniper you'd increase that to 42% (40% from the perk plus 4% of the remaining cases). Using targeted shots to the eyes which increase the critical chance by 60%, you'd have a "normal" chance of 64%, going to 78% with Sniper. In the latter case you'd "only" be up 14% as compared to 38%, and expressed as a fraction of the original critical chance the difference in gain is much greater. Sniper would still add something, though, in this case roughly equivalent to three levels of More Criticals. Similarly, making aimed shots will improve your effective critical chance even if you have Sniper, though the benefit is smaller at high values of LK (12% at LK 8 and 6% at LK 9 for eye shots) and you might then be better served by the extra shot or two afforded by Fast Shot. By contrast, the benefit of More Criticals fades to insignificance even at moderate LK if you have Sniper. With Sniper and LK 10 you get criticals all the time, but you can still get more damaging and/or debilitating ones by making aimed shots.</p></aside><p>Recommended perks (number of ranks in parentheses):</p><dl><dt>Action Boy (2)</dt><dd>Whether you need this, and if so how many levels, depends on your current Action Points and what weapons you plan to use.

Another advantage is that you can get Bonus Move at 6th level, compared to 12th for Action Boy. I can never find any good perks at the early levels, so I almost always go for Toughness and Bonus Move. And some extra move AP can be still useful even in ranged combat - for hiding behind obstacles." This argument was made for <em>Fallout</em> where the Super Sledge is the best melee weapon, but it has merit even without the knock-back angle. <em>Volcano</em> adds: "I find Bonus Move has its uses in ranged combat, when using heavy burst weapons like miniguns or the Bozar. It allows you to get a clear field of fire so that you can target the enemy without blowing apart your NPCs. And it allows you to line up critters to ensure hitting more than one with each burst. Wiping out six floaters with three bursts from a Vindicator is a lot of fun."</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Bonus Move is bugged so that if you save and load the game in combat, your extra movement AP will be available for use again, allowing you to move any distance in a single round.</p></aside><p>Possibly useful but not crucial perks:</p><dl><dt>Dodger</dt><dd>Protection is good.</dd><dt>Explorer, Ranger, Scout</dt><dd>These all improve your chances of finding special encounters, which can be helpful if you have low LK and play on hard difficulty, but mostly for the fun value, so don't take them until the late game.</dd><dt>Gain Charisma</dt><dd>This is useful if your new CH is an even number, which means you can recruit another party member... if you <em>want</em> another party member.</dd><dt>Gain Intelligence</dt><dd>Unless you start out with IN 9 this is good, but not a top priority if you have IN 7-8 already, which you should.</dd><dt>Gain Luck</dt><dd>Good LK will help with special encounters (maybe) and criticals, so take this in the late game if you can't think of anything else.

If your current CH is an odd number then Gain Charisma is strictly superior to this.</dd><dt>More Criticals (3)</dt><dd>Groovy, but the catch here is that if you get Sniper (and have a good LK) or Slayer, this perk will be made largely redundant.</dd><dt>Mutate!</dt><dd>There's one way you can use this perk efficiently: exchanging Finesse for Fast Shot at level 27 after you get Sniper (or taking it as your level 21 perk just before reaching level 24).

Note that this perk was changed after the manual was printed; the in-game description is the correct one.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Although it's not clear from the description, Lifegiver gives you +4 Maximum HP when you take it; you could say it works retroactively for the level you just earned.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Frank Shannon is not alone when he says: "I'm a little surprised you rated Lifegiver so low." Well, if you take two levels of Lifegiver as quickly as you can and play to level 30, you will have 140 more HP, and it's true that this makes for a good safety margin, especially in an iron man game. However, by that time you'll have run around in heavy armor and with resistance bonuses for a good while and you seldom have to worry about being slain outright except by massive critical hits that bypass armor. Lifegiver could save you in such a moment - and so could Dodger, abstractly speaking. Meanwhile, offensive perks which add attacks, maneuverability or damage will be working for you constantly. I'd consider taking Lifegiver before I considered dumping more char points in Endurance, but I still find it limited in appeal.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have CH 8 or 9 and didn't get the Mirrored Shades and/or Blue Memory Module yet, you may want to skip Magnetic Personality since you can't normally have more than 5 party members anyway. This perk is available from level 6, not level 3 as the manual states.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have only one trait when you get the Mutate! perk, you must exchange that for the new one, i.e. you can't just fill the other slot and keep the old trait.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p><em>Krum Stanoev</em> adds: "There's another fairly obvious way to modify your primary stats in-game with the Mutate! perk. You can start with an Agility of 6 and still get Sniper: you pick Finesse, then you pick Gain Agility to make it 7, then Mutate! to swap Finesse for Small Frame and get AG 8 for Sniper just before you make it to level 24." (Or you could take a dose of Psycho.)</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>One could make an argument such as this: "If you use Mutate! to change any mediocre trait to Gifted, you're basically getting seven Gain Foo perks at once. That's got to be the best perk ever." The problem with this is that it assumes you didn't get Gifted from the start even though you could have. The beauty of swapping Finesse and Fast Shot is that the benefit of Finesse and the drawback of Fast Shot disappear at the same time, namely when you get Sniper.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's possible to score more than one double-damage hit with Silent Death in the first round of combat, assuming you can position yourself behind two or more enemies without leaving Sneak mode (which is difficult if you have to pass directly in front of them).</p></aside><p>Perks I rather doubt the usefulness of:</p><dl><dt>Bonus HtH Damage (3)</dt><dd>Should have been a lot more damage.

Just spend some skill points to compensate.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>You can play a little trick with the Tag! perk. When you use it to tag a skill, it will raise the skill level by the same amount you already raised the skill, including bonuses gained during play (but <em>not</em> the initial 20% bonus). The trick is that before leaving the character screen you can lower the skill to its previous level (gaining even more skill points if the skill went above 101%), and then spend the points elsewhere. Effectively this perk can give you an amount of generic skill points at least equal to the highest amount you've gained in a non-tagged skill, and potentially much more, which makes it far superior to every other skill point perk. Although a favorite of some players, personally I think it's no big deal, since I don't care much for skill points late in the game anyway. As pointed out by Volcano, the game keeps track of the skill level if it goes above 300%, so if you tag a skill at 299% you'll get several hundred points out of it - but if you tag a skill at 300%, you can't lower it at all!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>When you pick a skill point perk (other than Tag!) you can redistribute points only to the extent that you have previously raised that skill by investing skill points, reading books or getting one-shot bonuses. Survivalist is probably the most likely candidate of the bunch, but it's still much inferior to Tag! for the purpose. Also note that skill point perks raise skills by a fixed amount, no matter if they are tagged (in which case you lose) or higher than 101% (in which case you profit). This redistribution trick also works on a smaller scale when you buy a perk that raises a stat.</p></aside><p>Useless perks which should only be chosen if you have no other options (or really want to):</p><dl><dt>Adrenaline Rush</dt><dd>Gain an infinitesimal bonus, but first you'll have to be dying?

Someone with a Strength of 2 can throw things up to 6 hexes away. Taking Heave Ho! gives them an effective ST of 4, for a range of 12. However, the maximum throwing range is 8 for spears, and 15 for grenades. So raising Strength above 5 doesn't increase range at all. Characters with a Strength of 1 would benefit from this perk; it's completely useless with a Strength over 4." Throwing Knives have a maximum range of 16 hexes, but taking a perk to increase your ST 5 character's range with that particular weapon by 1 hex would seem to fall within the definition of "completely useless".</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Both Heave Ho! and Survivalist have only one rank instead of three like the manual says. Several other perks were changed (for example, all skill point perks), but their proper descriptions are in the game.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Here and Now gives you exactly the amount of xp needed to reach the next level; ideally it should be taken at a high level and after earning just enough xp to reach your current level. Well, ideally it should not be taken, but you know what I mean. You need to exit and re-enter the character screen to get the skill points and the new perk, if any. Volcano adds: "If you take Here and Now as your perk at Level 99, your accumulated xp total becomes 0. There doesn't seem to be any other effect." Taking it at level 97 gets you to level 99 (see note in the Area walkthrough introduction). This perk is available on level 3 instead of level 9 as the manual says; this is actually not a bug, but was omitted from the final patch readme.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 when you took Here and Now you gained an amount of xp equal to the total amount needed to reach your current level; starting at level 6 you would gain more than one level as a result, with the number of levels gained increasing with your current level. For instance, if you took the perk just after reaching level 19, you would double your total experience to 342,000 and rise to level 26. Of course, you would only be able to pick one perk afterwards. Juan adds: "When I pressed cancel and left the character screen, I saw that the text screen said 'You have gone up a level' 10 times, and my NPCs had leveled up... but they didn't lose their levels! So I tried picking and cancelling Here and Now again, and yes, my party members went gaining levels, over and over, until they reached their max level (and I still had the perk available)." With the patch NPCs will not have a chance of leveling up in this case.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Light Step is one of those mind-bogglingly stupid perks. Not only is the ability to avoid pressure plates decidedly minor, and not only does Light Step require you to pass a difficult AG check for each mine to do so, but they didn't even care to set this up for every floor trap in the game. In fact, the only places where Light Step is used are Redding and outside (but not inside) the SAD.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Contrary to what the manual says, the Master Trader perk doesn't make your own stuff more valuable, but gives you a discount on the value of goods you barter for (the <em>Fallout</em> manual has it right). The effective discount varies somewhat between shops: 20%, 25% and 50% have all been noted (probably because barter modifiers are applied cumulatively and not sequentially).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Pathfinder perk appears to be slightly bugged: the first level will cut 20% of traveling time (not 25%), while the second level doesn't seem to do anything at all. In <em>Fallout</em> the perk worked as it should.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Sharpshooter is bugged and doesn't really do what the manual says; it's supposed to raise PE by 2 for sniping purposes, yet often improves your chance to hit less, and never more, than increasing PE by 1. Michal Burger figured out that this is because the perk thinks range modifiers are calculated based on PE when it's in fact PE*2, and so increases your chance to hit only half as much as it should. At least it gives you a bonus even if your PE is at 10 already.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Swift Learner decisively wins the struggle for the title of most deceptively lousy perk. It may certainly seem like a good investment when you first look at it, <em>but</em> since the xp requirement for each new level rises linearly, even if you get all three slots of Swift Learner you only ever stay a few levels ahead of someone who doesn't ruin their early game wasting invaluable perks. For starters, you have to wait until level 17 before you're even <em>one</em> whole level ahead of the "slow" learner, and if you eventually get to level 30, which should not be until the game is over anyway, you'll still be only <em>two</em> levels ahead. So, that adds up <em>eventually</em> to a few HP and skill points, for three perks... Simply put, do not choose this perk even if it threatens you with a radiated stick.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>There are a few implemented perks which you cannot gain, namely Animal Friend, Flower Child, Mental Block and Scrounger.

Well, of course you could do that (and probably even finish the game), but in that case it'd be pointless for me to tell you what to do. Also I don't think you could squeeze as much out of the game as you could with a generalist. For one thing, those options will be more or less available to you anyway by the time you need them.

I won't spell this out every time, though, so in the walkthrough, "Childkiller" should be read as "having killed two children or more".</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If any of your NPCs kills a child you don't get the Childkiller reputation.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There are a few kids who increase your child kill count twice because of a script redundancy (and thus instantly make you a "real" Childkiller): these are Jonny in Modoc, the Slag kids, and Curtis in Vault City.</p></aside><p>Your actual karma level will be described using the karmic titles, from "most good" to "most evil": Savior of the Damned, Guardian of the Wastes, Shield of Hope, Defender, Wanderer, Betrayer, Sword of Despair, Scourge of the Wastes and Demon Spawn. Each 250 karma in either direction from 0 will earn you a new title. I find that being a shameless opportunist will net you high positive karma in the end - which could mean that the designers have strange notions about morality, but more likely just reflects the fact that there are more good things to do in the game than bad ones.</p><p>Reputation in specific towns are reflected by the standings: Idolized, Liked, Accepted, Neutral, Antipathy, Hated and Vilified. Like your karma level this is a representation of a numeric value, only this one is hidden. You always start out as Neutral when you come to a place, except Klamath where you're Accepted if your CH is 6 or more, and Vault City where you start out with Antipathy. In Arroyo, of course, you're Idolized. Sadly it's not possible to reach Idolized in all settlements if that's your aim. At the Ghost Farm, for instance, you can't advance beyond Neutral even after saving all their sorry asses.</p><p>It should be noted that karma and reputations all have a much smaller general impact on the game than one might think. They make a difference in the case of critters that look directly for certain reputations or threshold values of karma or town reputation, but the basic reaction system that factors in everything at once is hardly used at all and doesn't even work properly. It won't really make any difference whether you have 500 karma or 1500.</p><h3 id="character-design--radiation">Radiation <a class="header-link" href="#character-design--radiation">🔗</a></h3><p>And now for some stuff on radiation, which does play a small part in the <em>Fallout</em> world. Sources of radiation include Fruit, golden geckos, and aliens and centaurs in random encounters. Whenever you get a huge dose all at once, the message window says "You have received a large dose of radiation." As explained in the patch notes, the radiation sign pops up once you've reached 66 rem.</p><p>As far as I can tell radiation damage works like this: some time after you absorb a dose of radiation, you'll get one of the messages listed below, and you may temporarily lose stat points, Healing Rate and current Hit Points. The severity of the "attack" depends on your total rem count, but also on the amount of recent radiation that triggered the message. After 7 days, your stats will return to normal. A little confusingly, this is signaled by another message identical to the first one. If you absorb more radiation in the meanwhile, your current penalty may be replaced by a more severe one.</p><p>Here's a list of the penalties you may suffer. The rem figures are rough approximations.</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Rem</th><th scope="col">Message</th><th scope="col">HR</th><th scope="col">CHP</th><th scope="col">ST</th><th scope="col">PE</th><th scope="col">EN</th><th scope="col">CH</th><th scope="col">IN</th><th scope="col">AG</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">&gt;0</th><td>"very nauseous"</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&gt;150</th><td>"slightly fatigued"</td><td></td><td></td><td>-1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&gt;300</th><td>"vomiting does not stop"</td><td>-3</td><td></td><td>-1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&gt;450</th><td>"hair is falling out"</td><td>-5</td><td>-5</td><td>-2</td><td></td><td>-1</td><td></td><td></td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&gt;600</th><td>"skin is falling off"</td><td>-10</td><td>-15</td><td>-4</td><td>-3</td><td>-3</td><td>-3</td><td>-1</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">&gt;1000</th><td>"intense agony"</td><td>-10</td><td>-20</td><td>-6</td><td>-5</td><td>-5</td><td>-5</td><td>-3</td><td>-6</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You will expire from your condition if any of these stats except for Healing Rate (including CH) drops to 0 or below. This is checked only at the moment when they are lowered, so you may be able to use drugs to stay alive. Assuming you don't die in this manner, you can live with any kind of rem count and still run around with no penalty whatsoever. In any normal game, radiation is not a significant factor; in fact, in order to reach even 300 rem you'd have to run several laps around the Gecko reactor room or purposely hang around the Toxic waste dump. From what I can tell, there is never any permanent damage resulting from radiation.</p></article><hr><article><h2 id="area-walkthrough">Area walkthrough <a class="header-link" href="#area-walkthrough">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>Do I look like a cartographer? You want to scour the desert for them, you go right ahead.</p><footer><cite>Myron</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Each area walkthrough follows roughly the same pattern: first a general run-down of important people to talk to and things to do that aren't technically quests, then a numbered list of quests just as they're presented in your Pip-Boy (including typos!). Solutions to some quests are spread across several areas. This is not strictly a walkthrough in the "do this, then do that" sense, but there's enough information and general advice that you should be able to figure out how to do stuff, and have more fun in the process.</p><p>Locations on the world map are marked with circles in three sizes. The ones with a large green circle (town-size) can always be found even if you don't know it's there beforehand, while the other two (cave-, farm- or base-size) generally don't appear until someone's revealed their location to you. There are two exceptions: Vault 15 and the Raiders location are medium-sized but are there from the start anyway (see the Raiders section for some speculation on this anomaly). Also note that the Military Base is counter-intuitively city-sized. The difference between small and medium locations are that the small ones don't have town maps.</p><aside class="green"><p>It should be noted that not all dialogue options described in this walkthrough will be available to a character with middling ability or skill scores (typically IN or Speech). As a rule of thumb, "smart" dialogue options require IN 6 or 7, while "super smart" ones take IN 8 or 9. (There are a few IN 10 lines in the game, but all of them are inconsequential - Karl, Laddie and Gregory have them. Karl's is even a typo in the script.) You can always try chewing Mentats if you have them.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There are ugly tricks you can play early in the game if you know where to find certain locations and items, such as going to San Francisco from Arroyo, then to Navarro and get the Advanced Power Armor, Pulse Rifle and about 25,000 xp right away. This pretty much spoils the entire game for me, so I'll just do this in the order I usually go places.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The game will end after 13 years of game time (which would correspond to 25 Jul 2254). This event will be marked by a slightly animated screen saying "the end". Even if you play a "go everywhere, do everything" kind of game, you should only use up 3-4 years at the most, and even if you want to walk around the wasteland leveling up endlessly from mindless random encounters, you should be fed up before 13 years have elapsed.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Speaking of leveling up endlessly, you cannot advance beyond level 99. (Oddly, when you reach the 4,753,000 xp needed for level 98 you gain two levels at once, skipping to level 99.) This should not really be a problem, either. In <em>Fallout</em> the limit was 21...</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>At any time when you get to choose your destination on a town map, you can press a number on your keyboard instead of clicking a green triangle. This way you end up on a location in that town corresponding to the number you pressed, even if you didn't have access to that area previously. This can be used in various ways for convenience or cheating (Alex del Río notes you can enter the Gecko power plant after blowing it up by pressing 2 on the town map and getting another 2500 xp when you get out of there), but needless to say it could interact weirdly with quests and dialogues, and you can even end up getting stuck inside walls, so don't do it in a serious game unless you know exactly what you're doing.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Another general cheat/bug... pressing 0 (zero) in any conversation will instantly end it. For instance, if someone says they're going to kill you, and you press 0, they may not turn hostile, or if you end up in a dialogue thread which leads only to an undesirable end, you can abort it entirely. (e.g., you could get out of fighting Darion in Vault 15 and then kill him with Super Stimpaks, if for some reason you don't feel like fighting his gang.) Using this "trick" may prompt unexpected dialogue and cause quests to reset or abort - you have been warned.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Sean Meskill discovered a way to rest anywhere: "When you have enough status entries (names of locations) that they start to physically appear in the space where the alarm clock entries appear, then you can do the trick. Go someplace where you cannot rest. Enter the Pip-Boy. Press status. Press the alarm clock, then after it says you cannot rest here click a status item that physically corresponds to an alarm clock item. It will then switch to the rest menu, with the rest option that is in the same place as whatever status item you pressed being used. Usually you can't rest very long doing this, but you can do it as many times as you want. Very useful." Once the rest options appear, you have to click in between them. You need quest entries for at least four locations to be able to access the "Rest for ten minutes" option, and you can never access "Rest until party is healed".</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Michal Zalewski found another exploit: "If you are at the brink of an impossible to win encounter, and have no other options (say, you are on the second floor of one of New Reno casinos and have a lot of hostile guards below and only one exit), you can save your game, go to the main screen, hit <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> and load an arbitrary map, then load your game, walk past the combatants (they will not notice your proximity) and reach safety, save again, hit <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> and load the last save in the normal mode. Although it is cheating, it is sometimes a better option than replaying several hours of the game. If you feel particularly naughty, you can plant explosives near critters or kill them with Super Stimpaks. This also works if you want to avoid certain scripts. The method won't work if you have already entered combat mode. As a side note, there are some funny consequences to entering the combat mode while in <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> - most notably, it is possible to get killed, then walk away with negative HP. Quite unfortunately, you will still remain flagged as dead, so if you save the game and then load it in normal mode, the game will immediately end even if your HP is positive. The game may get mangled in <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> mode on some occasions (it is possible to crash it, or be stuck in endless combat mode), but it seems to be a rare glitch; once you get past <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> and load the save, there are no side effects as far as I could tell." Some scripts will still be active in <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> mode, e.g., a guard may prevent you from opening a door even if he won't attack. Experiment at your own risk...</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="world-map">World Map <a class="header-link" href="#world-map">🔗</a></h2><figure class="map-wrapper" id="world-map-wrapper"><svg

peaceful village. Except for the plants possessed by evil spirits... and of course, the temple of trials filled with those deadly spear traps and the man-eating giant ants.</p><footer><cite>The Chosen One</cite></footer></blockquote><p>After a cutscene with the village Elder you start outside the entrance to the temple, proudly owning a Spear. Don't attack your tribes-mate, there's nothing to be gained and you'll regret it very much later on. Enter the temple and you find yourself in a hallway. Kill the ants and press forward, exploring the side rooms and corridors. Open the second door using whatever puny Lockpick skill you may have. Kill everything (good xp at this point), loot the chests, pots and bones. Might as well bring as many Scorpion Tails as you can carry, too.</p><aside class="blue"><p>In the temple you might as well get into the habit of saving a lot. You may not need it, but it doesn't hurt. Save before taking on a bunch of scorpions. Save before disarming a set of traps. Save before setting the explosives or talking to Cameron. Save before taking the hidden elevator to the secret stash of energy weapons. Kidding.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>There's a helpful close combat trick you should be using throughout the temple, and whenever it's necessary. Attack your foe just once, then use your remaining AP to run away. They'll follow you, but may not have enough AP to strike back, which will simplify things. You can even run them around in circles if they refuse to die quickly. <em>Masklinn</em> adds: "Actually, the Temple of Trials mobs (ants and scorpions) can only walk 2 hexes and still be able to hit you. All you have to do is run 3 hexes away from them and you're safe. This means that a character with 9 AP can land two punches before you have to run, 10 AP granting you one Spear attack and one punch, or one kick and one punch. So basically a character at or above Agility 8 will do the temple a tad faster and easier."</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There's no point to using targeted blows in Temple of Trials or just afterwards, since critical hits are disabled for the first day of game time. Critical failures are disabled for the first five days.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>From now on I won't comment on this unless there are noteworthy items to pick up, but you should search all the bookcases, shelves, bookshelves, dressers, desks, lockers, chests, footlockers, fridges, ice chests, bones, pots, tables, stuff, workbenches, tool boards, wall safes, floor safes, ammo crates, poor boxes, pool tables, mining machines, iguana stands, boxes, crates and other searchable containers as you progress through the game. After a while you learn to recognize searchable objects on sight. Hard-core gamers will search <em>all</em> of them and take <em>everything</em>. 🙂 There are a few deplorable areas though which abound with empty containers, notably Broken Hills and San Francisco.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>In this game items on the ground or in corpses do not decay, so you can return and pick them up later on unless they're on a map you can't return to (which will, eventually, be true for all of Arroyo and the Temple of Trials). However, to pick up an item you must be able to click on it, so if a dropped item or a corpse is completely hidden by opaque scenery then it will be lost!</p></aside><p>On the second map your character will probably start spotting floor traps. If he or she doesn't, you can walk to and fro to make it happen, unless you have a woefully low PE. Should you have the patience, disarm the traps for 25 xp each. If you're reckless and set off a trap, you can pick up the Sharpened Pole which nearly lodged in your chest (or maybe did). To avoid the traps altogether, keep to the right-hand wall. At one point you're required to set an explosive charge (found in a tall pot nearby) in front of a door, which shouldn't be too difficult. Beware of the trap on the doorstep.</p><aside class="blue"><p>You see a raised plate" is the game's universal message that your character has spotted a floor trap, so pay attention and learn to identify them. Floor traps seldom appear alone. (Apparently, even in hi-tech military installations devilishly inconspicuous pressure plates are used to trigger traps. You'd have thought they could use, I don't know, motion or IR sensors instead.) If you fail critically while disarming a floor trap it will say that you accidentally set off the trap; this is not strictly true, as the trap often does not go off, but you can't attempt to disarm it again.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>You can set the timer on the explosives in your inventory and then drop it, or another way is to put it in an active item slot, leave the inventory window and use it from there; you'll then drop it automatically. Even with a puny Traps skill you can set the timer to the minimum of 10 seconds and run clear before the bomb goes off, whether you get the "explosive detonates prematurely" message or not.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>You can open a lot of doors and forcefields in the game using explosives, grenades or rockets, and also unlock containers, but you shouldn't make a habit out of it. Some weak doors can be kicked in or smashed with any weapon, but those are never locked anyway. Normal doors can only be destroyed by explosive damage, so Bozar blasts and Super Sledge wallops are out. Sturdy doors need three blasts to destroy them, so I wouldn't bother, and many hi-tech doors can be expected to resist this kind of assault indefinitely. On some maps you can use a Crowbar from inventory to unlock containers even with a modest ST, but on others it won't work.</p></aside><p>At the entrance to the inner sanctum you find Cameron, who represents your final test. There are three ways to get past him:</p><ul><li>Fight him unarmed after a conversation (and without access to your Healing Powder) for 300 xp.</li><li>Steal his key and unlock the door behind his back for 600 xp.</li><li>Talk him out of fighting (IN 4 required and Speech must be tagged) for 600 xp.</li></ul><p>Beware that even though he says it's not a battle to the death, it is - for you! He'll happily strike a killing blow even if you're at one Hit Point; you, on the other hand, have to beat 20 HP out of him at which point he'll end the fight. In the unlikely case that you happen to kill him you'll have to take the key and unlock the door (still 300 xp), but the villagers won't hold you accountable. If you fight him, afterwards you'll have to go back to the previous room where your belongings have been stashed in a chest. Then go to the exit grid at the top. Cutscene alert!</p><aside class="green"><p>Warlord notes: "You can trick the Temple of Trials final trial nicely, if you drop the Spear before talking. You just have to watch out, because if you drop it too close to the man, he'll pick it up in his first round and whack you up pretty good." You could even drop a Sharpened Pole for him to pick up; he'll do a little more damage with it, but he should hit a little less often, and he gets two attacks with it each turn instead of three.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Players often get sick of the temple after starting too many games that didn't progress very far beyond it. Actually it won't affect your game in any serious way if you just run as quickly as you can to each exit. You'll probably have to fight six or seven ants along the way, but that's it. As long as you don't have to fight Cameron the whole thing should be over in a couple of minutes. Personally I think the Temple of Trials is as much a part of the game as any other stage - and also serves to demonstrate the extreme range of playing experiences the game engine has to offer.</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="arroyo">Arroyo <a class="header-link" href="#arroyo">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/arroyo-68f9c9e5.jpg"></picture><blockquote><p>I wonder how my cousins in Arroyo are doing?

First off go talk to the Elder to get your quests proper, Vic's Water Flask and some cash ($152 to be precise, but you don't get it if your Intelligence is below 4). Klamath will already be on the world map.</p><aside class="blue"><p>As good an opportunity as any to practice being polite. Like I said in the introduction, I'm assuming you want to do as much as possible of what's available to you, and this means you really won't be able to role-play either an inherently noble character or a terminally sarcastic one. The former because there are several quests where you'll get your best result doing something "bad" to begin with, then following up with something good, as well as other borderline or outright evil quests which are simply too neat to pass up. The latter because it's a well-known fact that in computer RPGs which let you play an "evil" or grouchy character, you'll ultimately be punished for doing so because if you tell everyone you meet how ugly they are, they won't give you quests or bonuses. Such is life. You can always pretend you're role-playing a psychopath who acts nice outwardly because he knows it will suit his purposes, while all the time thinking of new ways to strangle people with their own intestines.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you attacked Klint or Cameron in the Temple of Trials section, everyone will be hostile when you arrive here. You can run to the exit of the village before they can kill you, but then the game will end. The game will also come to a stop if you manage to end combat (for instance by running to the hunting grounds) and rest until midnight. Same thing happens should you ever attack anyone in Arroyo (or even off them with Super Stimpaks), so don't.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Using the Steal skill on any of the unarmed wandering villagers and passing a Steal check will lower your karma even if you don't take anything (they have nothing to take). This can mess up your dealings with Hakunin, so watch out.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>On special dates your Pip-Boy will say things like "Happy New Year!" and "Happy Valentine's Day!". Ain't that cute. It also has its own screen saver which shows falling bombs.</p></aside><p>The nutty old shaman Hakunin will heal you to full HP and remove poison for free at any time, providing your karma is not negative. Talk to the not-so-bright Feargus by the well, then fix it (Repair) for 100 xp. This can be done no matter how low your Repair skill. Everyone else includes this in their walkthrough so I guess I should too: there's $100 in aunt Morlis' hut which you should go and grab even if you're not going to search all the containers around you... but you <em>are</em>, right?</p><aside class="red"><p>Ever wondered why there is at least one Feargus or similarly named character in each of <em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Baldur's Gate II</em>, <em>Planescape: Torment</em> and <em>Icewind Dale</em>? It might have something to do with Black Isle director Feargus MacRae Urquhart; there are close to a dozen names in these games derived from his (including <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>'s original name, which shows up if you sell him to Metzger). Names of other developers abound, but none of them sticks out as much. "Smitty" is another ubiquitous cognomen - there are four of those in the two <em>Fallout</em> games, and there might well have been a fifth...</p></aside><p>If you have AG 6, talk to Lucas by the stone head and he'll train you to Unarmed 40% if your current skill level is lower than that, else to 55% if you aren't this good already (a good reason not to tag that skill). He has a bag of Healing Powder, so take it and leave him with a few useless Scorpion Tails instead, since you probably can't carry them all into the desert anyway. If you want to barter, do it before the training. Talk to Jordan in the tent northeast of there for +10% to your Melee Weapons if your correct skill level is 36% or higher (if you don't meet the requirement you can return later in the game and get the training). Cameron at the top of the map will give you +10% Unarmed and +10% Melee Weapons, but only if your AG is 6 or less and you tagged none of the six combat skills (if you're proficient with Big Guns he apparently thinks you're ready to face the horrors of the wasteland). Depending on your starting skill you might want to get Lucas' bonus first. In case you forgot your stuff in the temple, or you have a craving to bash some helpless left-over scorpions, you can re-enter the temple by taking the northern exit grid to the front entrance or by entering the cave beside Cameron.</p><aside class="blue"><p>Skill rises received from training or other activities can be affected by whether or not you've tagged the skill in question and/or whether it's above 101%. Thus values given in the guide may not always exactly correspond to what you actually end up with.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Because of a bug you need to get Cameron's training before talking to Hakunin at all.</p></aside><p>During the game you'll see four Hakunin dream sequences, which will befall you on 23 Oct 2241, 21 Jan 2242, 21 Apr 2242 and 20 Jul 2242. When you leave Vault 13 after getting the xp for finding it (no matter if you got the G.E.C.K. or even talked to the deathclaws), or leave San Francisco after getting the tanker ready to go, you'll always jump ahead to the fourth sequence ("the village dies"). As time passes the garden and fields will go empty and people will become generally despairing. After 90 days, which corresponds to the first Hakunin dream sequence, you will be unable to get (or to finish, if you already got them) quests 1, 3 and 4, and Hakunin won't give you healing or make Healing Powder any more. After 91 days you'll be unable to get the Water Flask and cash from the Elder.</p><p>If you return to Arroyo after seeing the fourth Hakunin dream sequence, the bridge will be destroyed and the village inaccessible. A dying Hakunin will greet you with a story of how the villagers were taken south in vertibirds, and Navarro appears on your world map. You don't have to return here and whether you do or not has basically no effect on the rest of the game.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you find Vault 13 but don't enter it, Arroyo won't change, but Hakunin's description and dialogue will! This should be a pretty rare occurrence, but it did happen to me once. Hakunin won't actually die after you talk to him, and it won't put Navarro on your world map. Another funny thing is that if you're in Arroyo when you get the fourth vision and talk to Nagor, he'll tell you that Morlis cooked Smoke... but if you didn't rescue Smoke already, you can go and do that (although as noted above you get no xp for it and Nagor's dialogue doesn't change).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Arroyo bridge location will actually change to a whole new map, so if your <a href="#car">Car</a> is parked there at the time it will be lost forever, along with any NPCs left on that map or any other Arroyo map.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="arroyo--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#arroyo--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-arroyo1"> <span>Rescue Nagor's dog, Smoke, from the wilds.</span></summary><p>Nagor is to the east of Hakunin's garden, the dog is in the hunting grounds area to the west. Go there, kill any hostile geckos (or Sneak past them), grab all the Broc Flowers and Xander Roots you can get, and avoid stepping on the green slime. When you get to the dog at the top left it'll follow you back and even help you kill geckos on the way. The flowers and geckos reset every day if you leave the map and return. It may seem like an idea to stay here and level up from killing geckos, but actually it's much more work than it's worth, so only do that if you're close to leveling up already and can't wait (or see the note below). You get 100 xp for returning the dog alive. If you tell Nagor the dog died, he'll run off on his own to look for it unless you ask him not to, and he'll also take off if you turn down the quest. If you then follow him to the hunting grounds, he'll be lying dead next to a dead gecko, the dog will be gone, and you can't strike the quest off your quest list. But you can take a Spear from Nagor's cold body.</p><aside class="green"><p>Zuger's patented leveling technique: "The easiest way to get xp from stealing is from the drugged-up geckos in Arroyo. Just plant and steal Broc Flowers. Easiest way to level up early on in the game. Gets a bit tedious though. With a Steal of like 10% I managed to steal and plant Broc Flowers at least 5 times." Make sure there are no hostile geckos nearby if you do this, since the peaceful ones will turn hostile as well if you start a fight.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>In combat, all normal and golden geckos will run for and eat any Iguana-on-a-stick or Meat Jerky dropped on the ground, attacking if they have any AP left.

You get the Flint without losing anything (the game only checks your inventory before displaying the dialogue option, not after you select it), then you just have to pick up your Powders. It also works with upgrading weapons. Just get to the screen where you choose the specific weapon to be upgraded, then switch to barter and drop the gun before selecting it to be upgraded; you'll get the upgraded weapon (full of ammo, of course) from the person, then you can pick up your non-upgraded gun. Unfortunately, this won't work with Algernon, who won't barter, so you have to pay for the upgrade to make this work. This trick might also be useful in situations where you pay someone through a dialogue choice, like paying Metzger for <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>: drop all your money, then 'pay' him, pick up your money..." You can get all four combat implants for free in Redding this way, for one thing, as long as you carry $30,000 and one suit of Combat Armor. Sebastian Cassten who also told me about the trick notes that you can use it to keep quest items (such as the above-mentioned Flint), although this will appeal exclusively to item hoarders.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-arroyo4"> <span>Kill the evil plants that infest Hakunin's garden.</span></summary><p>Talk to Hakunin and agree to kill the plants, or just go and kill them.

Since it's possible you won't return here, scout the hunting grounds until you have an equal number of roots and flowers, then turn them all into powder.

Read the notice board to get a feel of what's going down. You can also talk to the town greeter, but he wants cash and it's a waste unless this is your first game... and it's not, is it? 🙂 For some reason he carries a Molotov Cocktail which you can steal and throw at him for a laugh. Or not.</p><p>In Klamath you find your first shops, one in the Golden Gecko and one at the Buckners' place, which both restock every 2 days. The Gecko is a rough place where trappers hang out (you need a low or middling town reputation to crash here), while Buckner House is a tad friendlier. Things you should buy include all 10mm AP, perhaps some Healing Powder if you don't have about 10 or so of those already, and the Leather Armor if you can afford it (especially if you're playing a melee character, since there won't be much else to invest in for quite a while). Stimpaks are in all likelihood not worth the price right now. Sajag at the Golden Gecko will give you a discount if you're charming enough, or if you just keep bugging him about it. If you rent a room at either establishment you're essentially paying $25 to rest 8 hours and recuperate HP equal to four times your Healing Rate, while NPCs aren't healed at all. I'd practice my healing skills instead.</p><aside class="blue"><p>Shops usually restock every 2-4 days, randomly decided (exceptions will be noted in the walkthrough). It won't happen while you're on the same map (though sometimes if you talk repeatedly to a shopkeeper they may reveal a weapon they were holding back for personal use), and also items won't accumulate endlessly. Items that a storekeeper keeps in regular stock will fluctuate in number (and choice items may not appear at all), but anything else you sell them will remain. Usually when you kill a shopkeeper, their inventory appears on their corpse even if you couldn't steal it off them previously, but not always. Of course, if you kill Maida Buckner or Sajag you'll have to fight the rest of Klamath as well.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Most shops in the game restocked significantly less often in v1.0, typically every 1-2 weeks. The patch notes only mention they get money more often, but it goes for the rest of their inventory as well.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>You never lose anything by converting unwanted items into cash, so you should take every opportunity to do so. This is because your items always sell for the same value; Barter levels, discounts and so on all affect the prices of the <em>other</em> party's goods. But one of their dollars always trades for a dollar's worth of equipment. This is also useful to know when you're buying something expensive and can't carry all the junk you'd like to trade in for it; just pay in cash, and then trade in stuff for that cash at your leisure. Note however that most shopkeepers restock money along with their other wares, at which time any amount of cash in excess of what they usually carry will disappear.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>This isn't going to bother you for some time yet, but your inventory can't display any more than $99999 in cash. Don't fret though, it's all there; the dialogue interface shows up to seven digits, and the variable itself can in fact go over 2 billion. If you're bothered you can keep $99999 in your inventory, $99999 in your trunk, $99999 on <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, $99999 on <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>, $99999 in your favorite bookcase, $99999 in the skeleton in the radscorpion caves beneath the raider hideout... you get the big overall general picture.</p></aside><p>In Buckner House a tribal-looking person by the name of <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> is standing about. Turns out he was looking for his sister (who was taken by slavers), but got drunk in Klamath, wrecked the place and is working off his tab. If you talk to Maida Buckner, you can offer to pay the $350 <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> owes, and he'll then join your party if you want to. Do this in conversation with <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, though, because then you get 500 xp that you won't get if you pay the money directly to Maida. There's a better way to free <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>: see quests 2 and 6 below. It's a good idea to do this as early as possible when you come to Klamath, so you can have <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> tag along. This isn't one of those stupid games where experience is divided among party members! The first thing you should do is take <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>'s Leather Jacket and wear it yourself to look cool.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: If you want to get <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> you must offer to pay his debt the very first time you talk to him. Always choose the second line in this conversation, and eventually you gain 500 xp and <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> if you want him (and providing your CH is not 1, of course). Since stupid characters don't get to do quests 2 or 6 this is your only chance to get him!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Sebastian Cassten notes that you can repeatedly pay the sum for <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>'s release by asking Maida about the Den. Basically you're paying to increase your town reputation.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 you don't get any xp for giving the money to <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>.</p></aside><p>Talk to John Sullivan in the Golden Gecko (use the "magic" dialogue path and get a free Beer) and you can get him to train you in pugilism for +10% Unarmed, +10% Melee Weapons and 150 xp!</p><p>There's a dog around. Talk to it, and if you feed it some Meat Jerky you'll gain a Trapper Town Key and the dog will follow you around the map (for as long as you don't leave the map it will actually be your ally in any fight you start here). Strange thing for a dog to be chewing on, really. Don't talk to the dog until you have something to feed it, or you may end up having to fight it (running off the map will calm it; if you kill the dog you don't get the key).</p><p>Visit Vic's old shack in the northeastern part of the map and get (among other things) his Radio. It will come in handy later on. In your first game, using the Pipe Rifle will probably seem like a really cool idea, but it's not very efficient, so save your ammo until you have the 10mm Pistol. Or if Small Guns is your only decent combat skill, might as well snipe rats in Trapper Town until you find the 10mm Pistol. Good, cruel fun.</p><aside class="rp"><p>The interior door of Vic's shack is locked and trapped. To find and disarm the trap, there's a traps skill roll. This is (probably) equal to your current traps skill level, so with skill 20 you would have a 20% chance of success. To open the door, the chance is your skill level -30%. Therefore, you need over 30 in lock-picking to even have a small chance of opening it. You can obviously try as many times as you want, until you get a critical failure and jam the lock. Stealing a molotov cocktail from Aldo, the drunken town greeter, and throwing it at the door is a viable alternative if all else fails.</p></aside><p>You can sleep with the women in the bathhouse, if you pay that is. Sally won't talk to you if you double-crossed the Duntons at the pastures, but you're not missing much. One of the girls, Jenny, is a friend of Vic's. Talk to her (you don't have to sleep with her first) and she'll put the Den on your world map. Maida Buckner, Sajag and Whiskey Bob can all do this, too.</p><aside class="green"><p>Extremely minor bug: if you get the CH discount for the "Round-the-World" option at the bathhouse with exactly $124 in your inventory, you'll get it for free.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: If you're stupid, conversation with the simpleton Torr takes on a most interesting character. He can put the Den on your map if you ask him about <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> before accepting <a href="#quest-klamath3">Guard the brahmin</a>. He'll also offer free accommodation (same effect as described above), but not until after you've accepted or declined the quest, and since Torr doesn't return to the town map if you finish <a href="#quest-klamath3">Guard the brahmin</a> properly a stupid character wouldn't normally get that option anyway.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In the unpatched game Maida puts Redding on your map along with the Den.</p></aside><p>The wicked Dunton brothers live in a house north of the square. At night they walk over to the Golden Gecko, which means you can loot their house. Pick the door as well (need Lockpick 70%). Talking to people and doing some of the quests below, you find out the Duntons are really scum. You can confront them about stolen cattle, but sadly there's no way of turning them in, and if you talk them into a fight the whole town including the Buckners will join in on their side. Attacking and killing the Duntons won't turn the rest of the town permanently hostile, though, so if you lock the door before attacking you'll be able to end combat afterwards and nobody will carry a grudge (running to an exit grid will have the same effect).</p><aside class="green"><p>The Duntons will each spawn a Spiked Knuckles in their first combat round unless they already have one. You can make this happen just by entering combat mode and clicking turn, then using Steal to get them, and repeat.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The first Dunton you kill will carry their "shop" inventory (which is pretty pointless and restocks only every 3 weeks) unless you did it on the brahmin pastures map. If you kill one of the Duntons, the other one will have disappeared after you leave the map and return. For instance, if you assassinate one then immediately talk to the other and take the rustling job, none of them will show up on the pastures map which means you cannot finish the quest.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>If you try to search the bookcase while they're in the house or if they see you in the side room, the Duntons will attack immediately. Usually though, possessive critters will give you one warning that you should stay away from certain containers, doors or exits. To do this they must be able to see you, so you can try Sneaking, or positioning yourself out of their line of sight. If you have NPCs you can use them as cover, as they seem to block line of sight completely for this purpose. However, don't blame me if these critters have a double take and come for you later!</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>Early in the game you may want to save before picking any important door if your Lockpick skill is not too high. A critical failure will jam the lock, which then cannot be opened until the next day, i.e. when the clock reaches 0.00 (though you can use lockpick items on a jammed door). At least you never have to worry about Lockpicks breaking. Should you ever be disappointed that unlocked doors don't give you any xp, you can instead lock them for 25 xp. Great fun, eh?</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>If you're playing without children, here in Klamath is where you'll hear your first disembodied voices. When it happened to me the first time, I thought it was my own character talking to the dog!</p></aside><p>Trapper Town is the western part of Klamath. Go up the passage between the two large buildings, then through a door to the right, and you'll find Slim Picket who will train you in Outdoorsman if your skill level is 28% or lower (so if you steal the Scout Handbook from a kid nearby, don't read it yet). If he says something about your tribe being "mostly farmers", just try again. This will add a percentage number equal to double your Intelligence (but not less than 7). He'll ask either $50 or $100 depending on town reputation, but due to a glitch you actually get money instead of losing it. If you turn him down after he states his price you won't get another chance.</p><aside class="red"><p>Before the patch Picket wouldn't give you money, but he wouldn't take it, either. The current state of affairs is the result of a "fix" mentioned in the patch notes.</p></aside><p>It turns out Slim's shut off access to the northern part of the area due to rat encroachment. To pass the locked door, you can:</p><ul><li>Pick the door for the usual 25 xp.</li><li>Steal the key from Slim.</li><li>Barter for it (will cost you $1).</li><li>Use the key you got from the dog earlier.</li><li>Convince Slim he should let you have the key (for any of several reasons).</li><li>Sleep with him if you're a woman.</li><li>Toss Aldo's Molotov Cocktail at the door.</li><li>Take the key from Slim's cold, dead body.</li><li>Get the key from Slim right away if your IN is below 4.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>If you're a woman and tell Slim you'd "give anything" to get the key, the lines of dialogue you get are messed up. What they do is, respectively: agree to his proposal, back up the dialogue, and leave dialogue. If you should select the first by mistake you can console yourself with the fact that the script never calls the sex procedure, so technically speaking there's just a fade-out...</p></aside><p>So much for security. Wend your way through the complex to the north (picking up the boots and ammo from the lockers) until you find a hole in the floor, and climb down. You'll now find yourself fighting through three cavernous levels with pretty much rat in them. Several minor items are hidden on the ground including a Sledgehammer, there's a 10mm Pistol (probably your first half-decent weapon) on a trapper corpse and a Combat Knife in the rat nest, and you can find a Tool by a scattered robot corpse in one corner. Near the southwest corner of the second (lowermost) level there's a caved-in section; move the mouse around above the big pile of bones and you'll find some 10mm JHP ammo.</p><p>Behind a locked door (use the Dynamite on the shelf if your Lockpick is not up to it, 70% should be enough) you'll find a ladder up, leading to a part of Trapper Town which was previously inaccessible. Take the Nuka-Cola from the ground and loot the fridge to the northeast, but most importantly walk over to the <a href="#car">Car</a> and pick up the Fuel Cell Regulator, which is worth 200 "invisible" xp.</p><aside class="blue"><p>Near the <a href="#car">Car</a> there's a working Nuka-Cola machine. Use a coin on it and you get a Nuka-Cola, and possibly hit for 1-2 points of damage by the violently ejected bottle. There are plenty of these machines in the game (working and broken ones have different descriptions), and you can get 15-30 bottles from each before they run out of stock. A Nuka-Cola trades for more than $1... but as a rule you'll want to convert equipment into cash rather than the other way around. However, Nuka-Cola is an ingredient for making Super Stimpaks later on, so you may want to keep this in mind, though chances are you'll have plenty more than you'll ever need anyway. Strangely enough, these machines replenish their stock every 1-7 weeks.</p></aside><aside class="yellow"><p>If you can't find the 10mm Pistol it's probably because you left the rat caves in order to rest up, during which time the corpse disappeared leaving the gun obscured by the remaining pool of blood. While bodies decay in mere hours if you leave a map and return, blood is quite persistent and can literally remain for years. The specifics of blood decay are not known to me, but it appears to depend on time as well as the number of times the map has been entered.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>On the floor of the first level of tunnels there are Rocks. Rocks, man, Rocks! Here is the Rock challenge: how many Rocks can one gather through the course of a game, without resorting to recurring random encounters?

He'll offer $50; if you ask for more he'll tell you $65 if you pass a Barter check, but only give you $55 when you're done (scripting glitch). Go to the southeastern exit grid into a wooded area full of geckos. Make your way down to the shack to the southwest, grab one of the Firewood heaps and use it on the still for 100 xp. When you return to Bob, he'll give you your agreed-upon monetary reward. Because the golden geckos can be a definite pain and because of the issue of pelts, you may not want to do this until you've got both <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and the Gecko Skinning perk (see below). If you feel like it you can reveal the location of the still to Sajag for $50 and a Beer (and 100 xp, though it doesn't appear in the message window), after which Whiskey Bob won't much like you any more. You must do this before you collect your reward from Bob, so you have to choose your allegiance. You can ask Sajag to tell you about his booze connections in the Den, but it doesn't do anything once you get there.</p><aside class="green"><p>This is one of the few timed quests in the game. Like the man says, you need to refuel the still within a day or you don't get any xp from doing so, but you <em>can</em> go to Sajag after Bob gives you the what for.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Whiskey Bob won't talk to you if your town reputation is Neutral and your karma is -3 or worse. To remedy this all you have to do is nudge your town reputation in either direction, which should be easy enough (buying a round of drinks will do it). This is the result of a bug: he was supposed to snub you off if you have a negative town reputation, but instead the script checks the global variable with the same identifier as the current Klamath town reputation.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>Here you may run into your first golden geckos, who radiate you when they hit you. I would suggest you don't use any RadAway before leaving Klamath and the Toxic Caves altogether, since we're not talking high levels of radiation. See the end of the Character Design section for more detailed info on radiation. Under most circumstances you should be perfectly safe not taking any RadAway before you get to the doctor in Vault City (or ever, barring some extreme happening such as ending up in the Toxic waste dump repeatedly).</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-klamath2"> <span>Rescue Smiley the Trapper.</span></summary><p>Ardin Buckner's fiancé is missing. She'll put the Toxic Caves on the world map for you and ask you to find Smiley. Do so (see the Toxic Caves section), and she'll reward you with either <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>'s freedom (you get 500 xp although it doesn't show in the message window) or $100. Talk to Smiley afterwards and he'll give you the Gecko Skinning perk and, if you talk to him again and ask him about gecko hunting, a random Outdoorsman rise from +1% to +6% (save and reload if you're greedy). If he says you already know more about hunting than he does, persist and you'll get the bonus anyway. If you have Gecko Skinning, every gecko you kill (except the fire variety) will have a pelt in it which you can grab and sell. Should Smiley perish then Ardin won't talk to you any more if you tell her.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: If you return later in the game to get the Toxic Caves on your map using Mentats and rescue Smiley, you'll get the Gecko Skinning perk but not the Outdoorsman rise or any reward from Ardin.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can get double xp for this quest if you get the location of the caves from Mrs Buckner but say you can't help her. Then go and rescue Smiley. When you return to Klamath Ardin will still be talking about him, so you can accept the quest, go to the caves and rescue Smiley again, then go back to Klamath for your reward. There will be two Smileys in Klamath, each of which will give you training. For this to work, you cannot enter the Toxic Caves in between saving the first Smiley and reactivating the quest, not even by saving and loading the game. Also you may want to avoid talking to the first Smiley directly after getting the quest, since he will then start following you around Klamath thinking you're in the caves.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Sebastian Cassten adds: "You can actually gain 1000 xp for recruiting <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>. First do one of Ardin's quests and ask either for no reward or for <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>'s freedom so that you get 500 xp. Now before going to Maida, talk to <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>. You will notice that he isn't free yet ('cause you haven't talked to Maida). You can now if you want to pay the 350 bucks for an additional 500 xp reward." This does not work in v1.0, however.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you agree to search for Torr before you get the quest to find Smiley, you must resolve <a href="#quest-klamath7">Rescue Torr</a> before you can get this one.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 you could get infinite training from Smiley.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-klamath3"> <span>Guard the brahmin.</span></summary><p>Torr who's not so smart wants help guarding his herd of cattle from "bugmen" who come at night. Don't talk to him until you're ready, because he'll only ask you once (but see <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a> for an additional way of getting this quest). Agree to help and you're teleported to a wooded area where the brahmin are to be found. A radscorpion appears, which you should be able to take out easily. Is this the truth behind Torr's insectoid bugmen, I wonder? Nearby there are several more, if you kill every one of them you'll have completed this quest for 250 xp, but if you want to switch to <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a> instead, don't kill them for now.</p><p>There's another, less obvious way of finishing this quest. Two shady figures are standing to the west of Torr's camp, namely the Dunton brothers. Approach them and they'll ask you for help stealing the cattle (this will activate <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a>). Agree to do so, but then tell the Duntons to call off the plan (Speech check needed), after which they run off. This gives you the same 250 xp and +50 karma as above, although the message window doesn't show anything. Optionally kill the scorpions for combat xp.</p><p>In a shack to the southwest you can find a pair of Radscorpion Limbs, which have been used by the Duntons to masquerade as bugmen to get at Torr's cattle. Sadly there's no way to confront them about this (a snippet of such dialogue exists, but is unused), so the Limbs are worthless. Beware that once you leave this map you can't get back to it, so don't leave anything here and bring all the scorpion tails you can carry.</p><aside class="green"><p>Sebastian Cassten notes that after you scare off the Duntons you can tell Torr to run away as well (see <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a>). This will let you get <a href="#quest-klamath7">Rescue Torr</a>, which is really supposed to happen only if you finish <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a> instead. It also has the aesthetic effect of crossing out both brahmin quests in the Pip-Boy, although you never get the reward for <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a>.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's possible to get xp for this quest twice. After you scare off the Duntons you can go to Torr and tell him you'll help guard the brahmin, which will reactivate the quest. Now kill the scorpions and leave and you'll get another 250 xp. This way you won't get <a href="#quest-klamath7">Rescue Torr</a>, though.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Sebastian Cassten has also discovered that you can pull off both the above tricks by relying on a combination of script imperfections. Convince the Duntons to run off, then kill the scorpions. Talk to Torr, but instead of using the mouse to navigate through dialogue, keep it still. Press 2 and 1 to trick him. When dialogue ends, immediately click to talk to him again, and select option 1 this time. Now your goal is to run to the exit grid in combat mode; do this by using all but one of your AP each time, ending combat manually and hitting A a lot. You will be successful if you get there before Torr manages to disappear (which will be signaled by a fade-out).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Killing a cow or turning Torr hostile will make this quest fail.</p></aside></details><details class="rp"><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-klamath4"> <span>Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin.</span></summary><p>Talk to Maida Buckner and ask about what's going on in town. She'll mention that someone is rustling Brahmin. Next, accept Torr's job to help him guard the Brahmin or do the shady work for the Dunton brothers. It doesn't matter which one as the important part is to check the shack and collect the Radscorpion limbs as evidence from the grazing area.</p><p>When you have the scorpion limbs you can go and report to Ardin Buckner, but she'll just tell you she needs more evidence. To find more you can go over to examine (binocular icon) the Brahmins behind the Dunton's place. There is a perception roll check here and if you don't make it you can keep trying until you do. Anyway, you will notice they have different markings that someone has branded over. With the 2 clues, you can now prove the Duntons were rustling and collect a reward (300xp or $150). It doesn't really matter in what order you do things, you can even kill the Duntons first and then start the quest (though you must find the scorpion limbs before you can report the rebranded brahmins).</p><p>Note: Once you have proven the brothers guilt and leave the Klamath map, they will be gone forever.</p><p>*You can also confront the Duntons about the evidence you found, as long as you haven't reported the rebranded brahmins to Ardin yet. You need a speech of at least 51% to get the option to do so peacefully (250xp). If you fail they will turn hostile and you will have to fight them. Keeping that in mind, you might want to confront them while you're on the grazing area map or in their home, because if you are in the Golden Gecko and that happens, all the people there will turn hostile as well. Once you have confronted them, they will no longer talk to you.</p><p>Note: Before the whole town except for the Golden Gecko would go hostile, this has now been switched around.</p></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-klamath5"> <span>Rustle the brahmin.</span></summary><p>Instead of scaring the Duntons away you can return to Torr and tell him to take off (they say you can knock him out, but this will rile the brahmin, and even if you <em>do</em> manage to beat him unconscious it won't let you finish the quest), then go back to the Duntons for 150 xp, $50 and 5 Meat Jerky, or you can decline the reward for somewhat less of a karma drop (but, karma is not much of an issue). Might as well clean out the scorpions afterwards, though you don't get any quest xp for doing so. This would have been a better idea than <a href="#quest-klamath3">Guard the brahmin</a> considering <a href="#quest-klamath7">Rescue Torr</a> below, but since you can get that anyway this is mostly for nasty characters.</p><p>You can also get this quest by talking to the Duntons in town instead of Torr, providing you didn't go and get yourself a good town reputation. You only get one chance for each brother to ask for work, and once you ask, if you turn one of them down you don't get a proper chance with the other (see bug note below). Don't address them by name, since it may abort the work thread (which twin you're talking to is decided randomly each time). When you arrive at the pastures, you can talk to Torr and promise to help him guard the brahmin to activate <a href="#quest-klamath3">Guard the brahmin</a>, and then choose which one to complete as usual. Remember that once you tell Torr to take a hike, you can't finish <a href="#quest-klamath3">Guard the brahmin</a> by killing the scorpions, and that if you kill the scorpions the Duntons will leave even if you didn't collect their reward yet. If you leave the pastures without completing either <a href="#quest-klamath3">Guard the brahmin</a> or <a href="#quest-klamath4">Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin</a>, you don't get <a href="#quest-klamath7">Rescue Torr</a> or any xp, so that just plain sucks.</p><aside class="green"><p>If your Charisma is 10 when you enter Klamath for the first time, your town reputation will rise to the point where the Duntons won't offer you the rustling job. Arm-wrestling them once before asking will take care of this.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Killing Torr or any of the brahmin will set the quest to failed and cause the Duntons to run off. If you told Torr to run away and then attack the brahmin, you'll see a float over the invisible Torr after combat ends. This won't turn him hostile, though.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>From WraithUV: "Saving and then loading the game after you've scared off Torr causes the Duntons to no longer speak to you. This makes both quests impossible to complete." This apathy also means you can steal from them happily and if you kill them they'll still be alive downtown, but obviously this is not the ideal outcome.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>As found by Kwiatmen666 and figured out by Killap, completing this quest spawns a few new brahmin in the pen back of the Duntons' house which use Arroyo brahmin scripts. Attacking these will spell the end of your game.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you talk to one Dunton about work in town and turn him down, then talk to the other and insist on helping them, the dialogue will proceed as if you were on the pastures map. You can agree to handle Torr; this won't take you to the pastures, though you can still get there by talking to Torr as usual. Or you can have a shot at spooking them, giving you the normal xp for that (they won't actually run anywhere), after which you can go with Torr if you want, finding the pastures empty except for brahmin and scorpions.

To be safe from harm, you and each party member must be carrying a pair of Rubber Boots in your inventory. Even then, sometimes the boots will randomly melt, leaving you vulnerable (1% for each step, happens to your party members as well), in which case you might want to reload since that's 2 points of damage for each step you take unless you wear Metal Armor or anything else that absorbs plasma damage. However, for the heck of it you may want to do a little voluntary goo stepping. If you step on the goo repeatedly without protection, you'll soon get a message that your feet begin to itch. Eventually (after 15 steps to be precise) it'll say: "Your feet burn and itch for a while, but then they feel better." A month thereafter you'll grow two extra toes, which you can amputate in Vault City... and find an obscure "use" for even further on. And yes, this <em>is</em> the only way to get the toes (I searched the scripts).</p><aside class="green"><p>If you came here in the <a href="#car">Car</a>, it'll be on the edge of the screen and you can't access the trunk while you're here.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Power Armor protects against the goo as if you're wearing boots. Hardened and Advanced Power Armor do not (so you get the toes if you didn't already), but they nullify the damage. The boots have no effect on bad goo in other areas than this one.</p></aside><p>Kill as many geckos as you need to in order to get past, and make sure to raid the locker for boots and stuff. Go down the ladder and make your way to the northeast (avoid the middle tunnel, it has the most geckos). There you'll find an elevator, a broken generator, and a trapper. If this is your first visit you probably won't be able to do much about the first two, so talk to the third (after raiding the locker on the wall, a container type which is easily overlooked). Once you bring him to the cave mouth, he'll make it on his own and you earn 1000 xp. Then after you've been to Klamath and got the Gecko Skinning perk you can return here and take out any remaining geckos.</p><aside class="green"><p>Smiley will join you fighting the geckos even before you talk to him if you're right outside where he's standing. He's not overly effective, though.</p></aside><p>Once you return here with a beefed-up Repair skill (or <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>), you'll be able to fix the generator (50-60% is recommended, a Tool won't provide any bonus). Next you'll have to use an Electronic Lockpick on the elevator door, or it won't open. Go down, kill the rocketbot, then loot, loot and loot to your heart's content: good ammo, a Bozar and a Combat Armor Mark II among other things. (Though the first time I got down here, I was disappointed the place was so small. I'd expected a full-blown base.)</p><aside class="green"><p>This is the only time in the game you need any kind of lockpick item (unless your Lockpick skills are horrendously bad).</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In the unpatched version there was significantly less stuff down here: no Combat Armor Mark II, no Bozar, no Plasma Pistol, less ammo. Also you couldn't use the Electronic Lockpick MKII to open the elevator.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>You'll want to kill the robot before it can take too many shots at you, which is where this little trick comes in handy. If you press and hold the A key as the game is loading a new area (such as when you get a random encounter on the world map), you'll enter combat mode and get the first turn before any monsters can react. Kind of a half-cheat which takes advantage of the game engine. Another time you may want to use this is in dialogues where you say things like "Eat grapeshot and die, scumbag". The other party always gets to initiate combat - that is, unless you hold the A key as you leave dialogue. In this particular case you can also use the trick to run past the robot before it can react; if you get to the doorway you'll be safe, even if there are NPCs in the robot's line of sight.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you ever wanted to have your very own Robo Rocket Launcher, you can. What you must do is kill the robot with a critical hit to the head that does no damage (try using Flares, or maybe punching; Better Criticals is a must). Because of a bug this means you get no combat xp, but neither does the bot purge its inventory of special items you aren't really supposed to get your hands on. Next you must knock an NPC unconscious on the same hex occupied by the rocketbot (make sure it's not <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> or <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, since they will freak out if looted while unconscious - assuming you care, that is), access their inventory, and finally click an arrow to select the robot. You should now be looking at two purple boxes representing one Robo Rocket Launcher and up to 18 rounds of Robo Rocket Ammo (which are equivalent to Explosive Rockets). This weapon has a very modest ST requirement and takes only half as many AP to fire as a normal Rocket Launcher, but it doesn't do nearly as much damage.</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="the-den">The Den <a class="header-link" href="#the-den">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/den-e505cc9e.jpg"></picture><blockquote><p>You'll not find a greater hive of scum and villainy.

The Den is divided into two areas, eastern and western. Both are full of foggy chem reliants, who may sometimes attack you unprovoked. If you hurt them somewhat they run away so you don't have to kill them, or you can probably run away yourself and then end combat. Actually you can kill them with no karma drop or other consequences, but don't make a habit of it.</p><aside class="rp"><p>'Petey' is a druggie that shows up in a forced encounter asking for money. Giving him some cash ($5) will raise your karma 1 point. This only works the first time, so don't bother giving him more. (You don't lose karma by refusing.)</p></aside><p>One thing you should be aware of right away is that the kids who stand beside doorways outside Becky's, Tubby's, Flick's and Frankie's will all try to steal from you as you go by (their skill is about 65%). The two kids outside Ananias' house are the only exceptions. Running past them won't help as their steal action is instantaneous, even if you see them working their steal animation on the screen only after you're already safely past (and if you fail a PE check you don't even see the animation). You might be able to Sneak past them, or another trick is to enter combat mode, go past them and end combat. Thankfully they don't steal from your party members. If you don't want to bother with entering combat mode, simply walk up to the kids you need to pass, let them try to steal, then use your own Steal skill on them one at a time to see if they got anything. If they did, use Steal on them repeatedly to get it back; they won't run off to sell the item until you move away, and if they catch you, nothing happens. You'll then be safe from these specific thieves for 1-5 minutes (usually enough time to be in and out of the building). If you don't get an item back, the kid will run to the nearest shopkeeper and fence it (those outside Becky's will cross the street to Tubby), in which case you'll have to trade for it if you want it back.</p><aside class="green"><p>If the shopkeeper a specific kid would fence their stolen goods to is killed, the kid will just stand there accumulating items until you leave the map, whereupon their loot disappears. (It can get a little bizarre, looking at their inventory. A kid who can carry a couple of Bozars should be able to make a living doing something else, no?) If you kill the owner of an establishment, leave the map and return, the kid or kids outside that place will be gone. So if you kill Tubby but not Rebecca, the orphans outside the casino will remain but won't have any outlet for their acquisitions.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Every time <em>you</em> try to steal something and fail, people turn hostile and attack, right? So how come you don't get to flip out and kill people when someone fails a steal attempt on <em>you?</em> Oh well... If you kill one of the kids no one will react directly except for the other orphans, but being a Childkiller is very bad. Alternatively, you could attack a kid with a Plant Spike or something and then let your party members do the actual killing, in which case you won't become a Childkiller. A more fun and expensive way is to carry only a bundle of lit Dynamite and stroll innocently past the kids, hoping they'll take it off your hands (removing your armor helps). If they have time to sell it off, however, it will explode harmlessly in the shopkeeper's offscreen inventory. Lancelot thinks flipping out in moderation is in order: "If you punch a kid and then exit combat mode, that kid won't steal any more and from now on will run away upon seeing you. So leave your party members somewhere far (because otherwise they will follow you and kill the kid) and punch every thief in town to teach them a lesson." Mason Pearce favors aimed kicks to the legs for this purpose and additionally notes: "You can kill the orphans without getting Childkiller by dropping armed explosives beside them. They enter combat mode and run for a round, but you can end combat immediately and they walk back to where they were in time for the explosion." They may go for you instead of fleeing, in which case you have to hit them once before they think better of that.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you don't have visible kids in your game, they'll still steal from you given the opportunity, but you obviously can't steal back. In this case you'll have to wait until your crucial item reappears in a shop, if and when you notice that it's missing. This can of course be extremely frustrating, especially if you have no idea about the kids in the first place, which would have been true for many European players (such as myself). Interplay's way of fixing the child "problem" may have included a minimum of effort on their part, but it's not very stylish.</p></aside><p>Tubby and Flick sell some interesting weaponry, such as Hunting Rifles, .44 Magnum Revolvers and 10mm SMGs (all stuff may not appear in their inventory right away). You might want to consider the rifle for <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, an SMG for <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and a .44 Magnum for yourself, but it probably means parting with lots of money in addition to whatever things you may have to barter. If you're not into guns you won't find much to invest in, sadly. You can kill both Tubby and Flick without pissing off anyone else (except Tubby's guards). Because you gain karma from Flick some people have concluded that this is a "good" thing, something with which I cannot agree. Nevertheless, killing them early on (bypassing Klamath, even) is a decent stupid short cut technique for those who like that kind of game. Tubby restocks in 1-2 days, Flick in the regular 2-4 days. If you ask Tubby about chems, you can pay him $100, or offer $50 and make a Speech check, or threaten him if you have ST 8 or the Presence perk. This puts Redding on your world map even though he doesn't mention the place.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: Flick won't even talk to you, so you can't barter with him.

People have suggested various strategies to get rich at the craps table, but I can't be bothered to put them here. See the Redding section for less complicated ways of making money in a casino. Personally I never gamble in this game. Listen to Leanne talking about the Master for 350 xp. You'll have to buy her a Nuka-Cola for $5, but cheap xp can't be bad.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you assassinate Rebecca, leave the map and return, most of the guards and casino patrons will be gone.

Isn't this what they call favoritism? You don't get the stuff if she's angry with you (because you smote kids or destroyed the still) or if you're stupid when you talk to her for the first time wearing leather armor.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>War story: Player (level 2) manages to piss off Joey in conversation, runs into Becky's chased by thugs, and hides behind Rebecca. Joey fires at player and hits Rebecca, casino guard fires at Joey and hits gambler. Eventually gamblers and townspeople are fighting each other and guards, guards are shooting gamblers and thugs, and Joey gets killed by Rebecca while still trying to shoot player. Then guard misses and kills orphan outside, two orphans storm the casino and even score a critical hit before being gunned down by the guards. Meanwhile, a guard accidentally hits another guard, guards start shooting <em>each other</em>, and as one guard runs out the door the entire battle spills out into the street! A few more people are killed out there. Combat ends, one of the surviving guards turns and walks back into the casino, while five or six guards and casino patrons remain outside, most of them severely wounded. One gambler, standing out in the street, comments: "Damn, Becky's was the only place to gamble around here!"</p></aside><p>Joey, one of the thugs south of Becky's, will try to sell you Jet for $500 apiece ($350 with decent Barter). No way! After you get <a href="#quest-den3">Get book from Derek</a>, Joey will put New Reno on your world map. Female characters can sleep with him for no gain. If you do, he'll move up a bit on the screen to a place east of Becky's casino, and after you leave the map he'll disappear from the game entirely (this is actually a bug introduced by the patch). So just don't sleep with him.</p><p>The guy outside the Brotherhood building is just damn annoying. In my first game I assumed his dialogue (or lack of it) was bugged. His dialogue will make more sense if you are level 4 or lower, which probably means you're playing a stupid character. If you return here later when you have access to this kind of building, it is empty.</p><p>Buying rat food in Mom's will replenish 2-8 HP for $10 (or $5 if you're stupid), which is cheaper healing than the Stimpaks that Mom will restock every 1-5 days. You can listen to Stacy's story of her cat for 200 xp if you buy her a drink for $10. It's a horrible story actually, but cheap xp can't be bad.</p><p>It's important that you talk to Karl in Mom's. Don't give him money or booze unless you have to, or he'll pass out for a couple of hours. Just ask him to tell you his story. If you anger him, for instance by offering him Nuka-Cola, you'll have to give him $100, a Beer or a Booze before you can regain the story option. Once you've completed the Ghost Farm quest in a peaceful manner, return here and tell Karl he can go home for 500 xp. Or if you're evil you can drive him crazy for no xp.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you attack Mom, some people in the Den will be upset about it. Karl will run from you randomly, but you can still talk to him. Frankie and Smitty won't talk to you, closing off any quest options remaining. Joey will be angry, but you can intimidate him and get the locket from him if you haven't already. Tubby was supposed to let you barter at a penalty, but due to a bug you'll get his normal prices unless you press the barter button directly after dialogue starts, in which case you get a <em>discount</em> (this only works if you're non-stupid).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you give Karl $1000 and then immediately ask him about the G.E.C.K, he'll offer you $1000 to sleep with him if you if you have CH 8.

If you fail he'll run away when he wakes up, but you can end combat and he won't be hostile.)</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: For stupid characters it is not so important to talk to Karl; he just takes half your money each time!</p></aside><p>There's a prostitute in the Hole with whom male characters can sleep (with or without the rest of the party) for a random amount of cash.

Female characters can sleep with a male customer and charge him $50, or $200 if you pass a Speech check.

Danforth's Non-Explosive Burning Fluid" is from a classic anthology of poems called <em>Spoon River Anthology</em> by Edgar Lee Masters. (It's also on a headstone in Nashkel in <em>Baldur's Gate</em>.) You may not find this specific headstone in the Den as the messages are distributed randomly between the grave markers in the Den, Redding and Golgotha when you enter the respective maps, although there are some that are always in the same place, such as the Winslow graves, Richard Wright, and so on.</p></aside><p>Over at Metzger's place you can sell your companions into slavery (any human except for <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>). The funniest thing about this is that the rest of your party act completely oblivious. Metzger is the only slaver in the game whose prices are influenced by Barter, but he's bugged so that you get more money the <em>lower</em> your Barter skill. The base price, which you'll get if your Barter skill is about 90%, is 1100 for <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a>, 900 for <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a>, 800 for <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a>, 1200 for <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and 1300 for <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>; at Barter 40% you'll get about 30% on top of this. Metzger has some minor stuff that he restocks every 1-5 days, and any items on sold NPCs will go into this shop inventory and remain there until next time he restocks, at which time they disappear.</p><aside class="green"><p>If Tyler has been killed for any reason, Metzger will attack as soon as you talk to him.</p></aside><p id="become-a-slaver">If you want to, you can also become a Slaver. This will make you hated by many people you'll meet in the game (<a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> and Keith Wright being some of the most important), and the only real benefit is that you get to go on slave runs organized by Metzger. In these slave runs, you're teleported to a map where you have to kill a number of "unruly" candidates for slavery, then report back for payment: $100 for each living slave (usually amounts to around $1000). You also get 500 xp for the first slave run. Metzger will give you new jobs until your total number of captured slaves is 30 or more. This means that by killing all the slaves in a slave run you can go on doing this indefinitely, quickly becoming a Berserker and getting bad karma to last you a lifetime. Ho hum. Perhaps more importantly, if any of your fellow slavers dies (you can kill them yourself and Metger won't know), this lowers the total "slave count" by 7 so that you may go on slaving. Just watch out that the slave count doesn't drop below zero, or Metzger will renounce your services. If you leave a slave run without killing all of the armed slaves, Metzger will have you shot on return (well, he'll try anyway).</p><aside class="green"><p>On the slave run map with tents there's a brown chest you can't open unless you have a good Steal skill, and if you do you get a message about stealing from the shaman's things. This is actually a script that was originally going to be used for Hakunin's chest.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0, if a slaver is killed in a slave run he may get up again, then freeze the game.</p></aside><p>Once you have a decent party, say, <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> and <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> armed with Combat Shotguns or the like (which should be the case once you return for the <a href="#car">Car</a>), you should go here and clean the place out. This will probably be a little harder for a melee character, but it is possible to win the battle at level 9 with <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> armed with Spears. If you don't want to take on all the slavers at once, try locking them in. You get 1500 quest xp for killing Metzger and 1250 xp for telling the slaves he's dead. Rebecca will also give you $1000 as a reward for killing Meztger, but only if you make sure she understands it was you who killed him (choose the "put up a good fight" line, you only get one chance).</p><aside class="blue"><p>Generally, whenever you decline a monetary reward you get karma points instead. Also in some cases you get other alternative rewards (in which case I will note it in the walkthrough, of course).</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>Because of how critter data is handled, chems used on one critter will affect all critters that share the same template. This means that if a slaver uses Psycho, all slavers will gain Damage Resistance, and if one of them uses Jet, all of them will gain AP. If you think this is cheating you can leave the map and return, or save the game and reload; doing so will cause the game to lose track of such changes. This feature can also be used in your favor if you ever have several identical people, e.g., caravan guards, fighting on your side. The game <em>does</em> properly keep track of drug effects on your party members.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you did <a href="#quest-den6">Help Lara attack Tyler's gang</a>, then whoever you fought for - Marc and Tyler, or Lara and her three gangsters - will still have a green outline and will fight on your side against the slavers if you take the fight down to the church. Taxi Driver adds: "Tyler happens to be rendered with one of the 'player' animations, meaning he can use any weapon in the game. Add a bit of spice to the slaver fight by giving him a Bozar or Vindicator Minigun! He may not be good with it, but I think this is a really classy way to clear out the East Side. Marc can only use a few weapons, but he can use sledgehammers which means you could have a bit of fun by giving him a Super Sledge. You can also load them up with Super Stimpaks and performance-enhancing drugs (or use the drugs on them yourself before beginning combat)." Tyler seems to favor small arms, so if you give him a Bozar he may stick to his Desert Eagle. Also I couldn't get him to use a Gauss Rifle at all; he'd equip it but not attack with it. He did OK with a Gauss Pistol, though. It should work with Lara as well, but you have to give her the stuff after the church fight since her inventory is purged before the attack.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Kit relates a strategy for this battle: "You can kill Metzger and his band of slavers at level 3 with a bit of ease. I have done it on several occasions. What you do is go with Lara's gang to fight the guards at the church. Once in combat mode, hightail it to Mom's Diner. At the diner, there is a back room with windows looking out towards the Slaver's Guild. What I did was pick the slavers off from the window, and take cover to the side of the window so that the slavers cannot hit you back. Lara's gang eventually helps out, but they are underpowered." As long as you have the firepower and ammunition to take the slavers out you shouldn't need to involve the gang (also at that time of day the darkness will be working against you); the slavers will tend to gather around your first victim and won't come running around the diner.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>PC and Björn Welin both claim that using Psycho for this fight works wonders even at low levels. Tubby will probably have a dose or two, Frankie has one but you'd have to kill him for it, and the guard outside of Vic's door has one you can steal. With your Damage Resistance maximized you'll usually only take a couple of points of damage per shot, if any. However, you'll still be hurt by critical hits. When testing this I found that I was slowly whittling the guards down while they used up all their ammo and finally started to run from me, so if you're alone and lack a way to deliver damage reliably this will still be a tedious project at best. PC also brings up stealing anything you can from Metzger and his people, while Björn Welin recommends using Jet in conjunction with Psycho on yourself and <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, reloading if you get addicted.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Pennyliu123 suggests stealing Metzger's Shotgun, locking the doors, and attacking through the window; only one or two of the slavers will be able to fire back at the same time, and if you step carefully between shots you may be able to stop them from returning fire at all. The Shotgun has a rather short range, though - shorter than the 10mm Pistols - so I'd prefer a Hunting Rifle for this method.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Sadly, Metzger won't react if you storm into his house flashing the Ranger Pin in your active item slot or if you try to push it up his nose. Nor does the Ranger map quest in NCR (about the "safe houses in the north") tie in with Metzger in any way.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="the-den--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#the-den--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-den1"> <span>Collect money from Fred.</span></summary><p>Talk to Becky, ask for work and offer to collect the debt. Fred can be found somewhere around, usually in Flick's house, looking like one of the other junkies (but identified as "a citizen of the Den"). You should demand $200 from him (you can do it even with mediocre IN and/or Speech, if you follow the conversation patiently) and once you do, you can let him keep $100 or $150 and return to Rebecca for $100 and 200 xp. If you let Fred keep any money at all, return after some time (either 3, 4, 5 or 6 months, randomly decided); he'll have used your money to get rich in Becky's casino, and rewards you with $2000, 200 Small Energy Cell, 250 Micro Fusion Cell and a Plasma Grenade.</p><aside class="green"><p>You were supposed to get different rewards from Fred - $500, $1000 or the full $2000 plus stuff - depending on how much money you let him keep and what you said to him. However, a scripting glitch ensures you'll always get the best reward (the variable in question doesn't carry over to the "new" Fred). So it doesn't matter if you only let him keep $100 (which means you break even after you return to Becky).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can give Rebecca $200 regardless of how things went with Fred, as long as you've at least entered dialogue with him after getting the quest.

If you don't make the Speech check you can bull your way in with ST 8. If all else fails, rest one hour and talk to Tyler again to get in, but then you won't get any xp for entering the church. Sneaking to get inside the church doesn't work, Marc will always spot you.

Lara will pay $400 for your help whether you actually fight or not. (If she's not alive at the end of the fight you can get the cash from her corpse.) It doesn't hurt to join in and try to grab as many kills (and thereby xp) as possible. You only need to kill the guard outside for the quest to finish, but go inside the church and continue the fight there.</p><p>There is another way to finish this quest. Tell Lara you need to prepare (you have until 6 a.m.), head over to Tyler and tell him about the plan, and he'll ask you to take out Lara instead when the time comes. Return to Lara for the attack but turn on her when the battle starts, taking the $400 from her corpse and earning $100 and 1000 xp from Tyler (for "helping Lara's gang to win the battle"). I wonder why you get bad karma from killing Lara instead of Tyler; I mean, aren't they both just random thugs? What, betrayal is bad? Oh well.</p><p>And, oh, two more somewhat counter-intuitive ways to finish the quest. One is to side with Lara, but then kill her entire crew before they can kill Marc. This earns you 1000 xp (again for "helping Lara") and the $400 from Lara's corpse, but no reward from Tyler (since he's not around). The fourth is to talk to Tyler as above and get to the fighting part, then take out Marc and Tyler even though they're green and Lara's gang is outlined in red. You then get 1100 xp for "successfully ambushing Lara's gang" (whee). Note however that if Lara is alive at this point she won't reward you, and the $400 won't be in her inventory (but if she died during the fight it'll be there as usual). It seems safe to assume that you were supposed to get xp from siding with Lara in the normal manner as well, but you'd have to kill Tyler for that to trigger, and you can't.</p><aside class="green"><p>Whichever side you fight for, you can run off the map as soon as you're teleported to the east side, then return and collect your reward (money from either gang leader, and 1000 xp if you sided with Tyler).

If you try to click on a portion of a body which lies atop the floor you won't get the hand icon. You'll still be able to loot the body if there's a part that's sticking out from the floor thing. You may also be able to return once the body has decomposed and pick up the items (for some items like pistols you must wait for the blood to vanish as well). These floor things appear among other places at a New Reno casino entrance and the Vault 15 vault door, and carpets and haybeds may complicate looting as well.</p></aside><aside class="rp"><p>This is another original quest that has changed. Instead of having to fight all of the gang at once, you only have to fight some of them at the church. After that battle is over, Lara will ask you to go with her to the party in Den Residential and fight the rest of the gang. You can take time to rest and heal first, but you cannot get out of finishing the job. You will then need to go back to the church to talk to Lara and receive payment.</p><p>* It is now possible to enter the BOS bunker here, after you have delivered the vertibird plans to Matthew in San Francisco.

The Great Ananias in the southern building in the west part of town will tell you about a ghost in the next room. Go there between midnight and 4 a.m., and you'll notice a shimmering figure. Bring out the Scooby snacks! "Talk" to the ghost and make sure you learn she's looking for her stolen locket. Go to Mom's for clues, she'll point you toward Joey. Confront him and either scare him with Anna's revenge (IN 6 needed), pay him ($50, or $20 with good Barter), threaten him (ST 5 and a Speech check, if you fail he'll attack), or kill him, and you'll get the locket. Return to Anna and give her the locket for 250 xp. It's so beautiful... Look what just materialized all over the carpet. Grab the bones, bring a Shovel (by coincidence there are two in this very room) and head over to the cemetery, where you'll find Anna's grave. Dig it up (once you've talked to Anna it won't make you a Grave Digger), put the bones in it and use the shovel again to cover it up for 1200 more xp (message window will say 600).</p><aside class="green"><p>Jörgen Thuresson adds: "You can kill the ghost in the Den. All you need to do is to cause a massive critical above a certain threshold. I did this once when I was fooling around and started shooting with my .44 Magnum. It was hilarious! Anna did the overkill animation and the body stayed around the clock. I was laughing my head off at the time. My locket! Mine!" Those massive crits are the ones that bypass armor; further investigation shows Anna has <em>no</em> resistance to plasma damage.

This is cheating, of course.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>The ghost is something of an anomaly in the <em>Fallout</em> world. There were mental powers in the first game, but such things are by many considered viable in science fiction.

You can kill the squatters (500xp), get them to leave peacefully (750xp), or, make a deal with them to help out at the orphanage in return for room and board (1000xp).

Maybe someplace else, then?</p><footer><cite>The Chosen One and Laddie</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Modoc is your average farming community. Although only Ed in Vault City will light it up on your world map, normally you'll come across it en route to that place. Jo has a pretty pointless shop on the left that restocks every 2-3 days (he'll get some more stuff if you trigger any of the Slag endings). If you're mean you can use Sneak to loot the shop clean. Stuff will actually keep spawning in the bookcase if you kill Jo.</p><p>Grisham who owns the slaughterhouse will ask you to guard his brahmin herd against wild dogs (he'll do this as you end the conversation). If you agree to it, you're teleported to the pastures. Ten dogs will appear from the north and pick a cow to gang up on. You need to kill all the dogs to complete the quest. Grisham will pay you $1000 minus $100 for each brahmin killed, and you get 250 xp to boot - except if you saved <em>all</em> the brahmin, in which case you get the money, but not the xp nor any town reputation increase (bug). Even if you have <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> it can be tough to keep every single cow alive; usually the dogs will kill one or two brahmin, then turn on you or an NPC. Since the dogs probably have a higher Sequence than you, it helps to run up a bit and then enter combat mode as quickly as possible, so that the dogs have to waste their "double turn" running. It doesn't matter really, since you're close to the point where money stops being an issue in this game.</p><aside class="green"><p>Warlord has a strategy which is a lot like mine: "You should have a Frag Grenade by now, so you throw it on the largest pack of dogs. The aim is to turn as many of them against you as possible. Then every turn you shoot some new ones - they will let the brahmin be and turn against you. If you have <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> you should manage to kill them without serious problems. This way you can save all the brahmin." Just, well, try to get one of them killed at least.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you don't manage to save a single brahmin (which happens if you leave the map without killing the dogs), things get a little buggy. Every time you talk to Grisham after that he'll demand $1500 from you. If you have IN 6 you can tell him they weren't worth that much, but this may trigger another bug which sends you back to the pastures, and paying him has no effect in any case.</p></aside><p>South of the slaughterhouse you'll find an injured brahmin called Bess. Use Doctor on her (try until you succeed if your skill isn't below 25%, a Doctor's Bag won't do the trick) for 200 xp. She'll follow you around the town for as long as you don't enter any of the two underground areas, or enter any map outside of Modoc. If you bring her to Grisham, you can put her up for... slaughterhouse treatment (karma -5). Bess will be moved to the cattle pen north of the slaughterhouse. You can either go and talk to her, have second thoughts and open the gate to let all the cattle out (karma +10, but your town reputation will drop), or return to Modoc some time later for 100 Meat Jerky stored in a crate in the slaughterhouse. Your choice.</p><aside class="green"><p>There may be other brahmin in the pen; if so, when you try to let them out they'll probably jam in the gate, being 2-hex critters. Placing yourself or a party member on one side of the gate helps them manoeuvre. After you release the brahmin, there will be a special encounter waiting for you somewhere in the wilds around Modoc...</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you leave the map after Bess gets out of the pen but before she gets off the map, she'll disappear and you don't get the karma rise or the reputation drop, and I don't see what would be the point of that.</p></aside><p>Irrespective of your gender you can sleep with either <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> or <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> in Grisham's house if you have at least Charisma 8 (CH 7 with a positive town reputation). Grisham will walk in on you and wonder what's going on. If you have a decent Speech skill and slept with a person of the opposite sex, you can tell him a yarn about a medical examination and he'll buy that... or else, it's time for a little shotgun wedding. Congratulations, you just earned the Married reputation and an NPC you can't get rid of (in the normal way, at least). In any case you have to pick up <em>all</em> your stuff from the floor, which can be damn annoying if you have like 200 Stimpaks, so a good idea would be to put your equipment on your NPCs or in the nearby bookcase before you go knocking on anyone's door. <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> and <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> are both absolutely useless as NPCs and can't level up, so you shouldn't marry any of them, unless you're evil and plan to sell them into slavery. However, you should save and try it once just to see the shotgun wedding... hilarious!</p><aside class="green"><p>There's a nasty bug here you have to look out for: if you sleep with <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> or <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> and don't follow through with the wedding, your party members stop following you; they will come with you from map to map but stay rooted except in combat mode. This can be fixed by either of the following: 1) Getting married. 2) Having the Val/<a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> conversation in Vault City. 3) Watching the Vault 13 video sequence. 4) Watching the Brotherhood video sequence in SF. Note that even if you don't have any party members at the time, you will still experience the effects of the bug if you should ever pick up any.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>More bugs: If you assassinate Grisham before sleeping with <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> or <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a>, the game will freeze when he's supposed to walk in on you. If you assassinate Jo (or if he died fighting the Slags) the game will freeze as it tries to arrange the wedding ceremony. Another bug will strike if you sleep with a person of opposite gender and pull the doctor stunt, and Grisham is blocked from leaving the room so that he ends up moping in a corner. If you then sleep with either of them again there will be a permanent blackout. It's quite possible there are other combinations of circumstances here which lead to the same kind of problem.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Actually you can just run from Grisham instead of talking to him or waiting for the ceremony to begin, but then all of Modoc will turn hostile (and you get the party bug).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you pick <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a>, <em>don't</em> choose the "you know you want it" dialogue - even though it's not clear from the wording, you'll rape her and turn the townspeople hostile! Even stranger, female characters can do this too.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You get your new spouse for an NPC even if you're already at your NPC limit, but remember, if you then kick someone out you can't get them back again unless you kick another one out in their stead (and you cannot disband your spouse). <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> will gain 2 Antidotes and 4 Stimpaks after you marry her, <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> 1 Tool and 2 Stimpaks.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>After you are married you will no longer be able to guard the brahmin or sell Bess if you didn't do that already. If you get Separated from your spouse, and then return to Grisham and tell him you think he or she is dead, he'll have a heart attack and die. I'm not sure this does anyone any good.</p></aside><p>At the Bed & Breakfast in the north part of town you can order some interesting meals. You can break the record eating brahmin fries and get slightly poisoned. If you order a glass of water for $1000 (you can steal the money back), you get a Cookie with it. Eating a Wasteland omelet for $25 will restore your HP to full and cure poisoning. If Cornelius should die, Rose won't talk to you any more.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can get a free omelet every time you talk to Rose (but nothing else).</p></aside><p>You'll hear rumours of a mystery chicken cooped up beside the inn... surrounded by a chainlink fence and guard dogs? This is begging to be investigated. Pick the door and kill the dogs once they attack; when that happens, sometimes traders nearby attack too, so you may want to be careful about this. If you don't want to fight the dogs you can open the door and leave the map; they'll be gone when you return. Also if you set off the toilet explosion the door in the fence may come ajar and the dogs will disappear. If you have ST 8 you can move the rocks in front of the door for 100 xp (I suppose Rose does this every time she goes to collect eggs), otherwise you'll have to plant some explosives. Open the door and step inside. That's some chicken. Since you've gone through the trouble of breaking in, kill it for the combat xp (if you can), but after you do, there'll be no more omelets available, naturally.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you open the door to the henhouse but leave the map without killing the... um, chicken, it will kill everyone on the map, including idle NPCs! And if you ever come back, it will hunt you down... Oddly enough this does not affect your town reputation.</p></aside><p>There are no changes to the plot or quests here, but something else that is new because of the Restoration Project, and this is the first (maybe the only) location where it is likely to happen.</p><aside class="rp"><p>As killap mentions in the RP read me, your character, and NPCs can now take damage from the outhouse explosion and/or falling through the trap at the Ghost Farm. While this may not be immediately apparent*, if you suddenly notice that you are unable to run, or that your NPC characters are avoiding combat, it is a good chance that someone has a crippled limb. And if you pay attention, your NPCs will actually complain when they are suffering broken limbs now.</p><p>Unlike hit points, crippled limbs do not heal over time. You will need doctor skill in order to solve this problem, as first aid will not help. If your doctor skill is low, you can try it several times and hope to be successful. The doctors bag will help also. If not, then you will need to find a doctor (maybe Vault City) that can heal the broken limbs.</p><p>*As of now there are two new crippled messages appearing on screen, just like "addicted" or "level". The new ones say "Crippled" and "NPC Crippled", so now you have no excuse for not knowing.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="modoc--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#modoc--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-modoc1"> <span>Farrel has a rodent problem in his garden.

Cornelius is actually a wee bit senile but will give you this quest if you tell him he "needs serious help". On a hunch, head over to the toilet, open it and climb down. You'll arrive in a dung-ridden cave, blocked to the north by rubble. Plant some Dynamite (set it for 3 minutes, it doesn't really matter) in front of the rubble and use the ladder. Yes, this is the fabled "toilet explosion". Har! You just redecorated half of Modoc in a very creative manner, earning 500 xp in the process. Return down the ladder, go north, fight a lone rat and search its nest... for Cornelius' Gold Watch, and also a Shovel (that and the rake must be the lost tools Farrel was talking about), a Fruit, and a useful Bag! Now go back to Farrel or Cornelius, give either of them the watch and say the rat had it for 1500 xp.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you assassinate Farrel, Cornelius will talk about nothing else (so you can't get or finish the quest if you didn't already), and if you say you did it all of Modoc will become hostile.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The placement of your Dynamite determines whether you take damage or not in the explosion as well as whether the rocks are cleared. Firstly, to trigger the toilet explosion proper the blast must "touch" the pile of rocks (being within 2 paces or so). Secondly, you and any NPCs will take damage if you're within the blast radius when you climb the ladder (the game always detonates explosives when you leave a map, hence why the timer wasn't important). If you're alone, you can easily avoid damage by setting the Dynamite as close to the rocks as possible, and if a party member is standing too close, prod him or her away before using the ladder. Saving first is of course recommendable in any case. It is actually possible (though unlikely) to survive the explosion if you stay down in the hole and hug a corner as the Dynamite goes off, but you might have difficulties with party members who insist on staying in the middle of the room ("<a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> was hit for 6772 points of damage and was killed." Whee). If you do this, you still have to exit the toilet and go down again for the rubble to disappear, so there's nothing to be gained.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>After the toilet explosion the Bed & Breakfast map switches to a new one altogether, which means that any items dropped here or put in containers (other than the lost and found box) will be lost.

I'll use this space to describe two "evil" ways of finishing the quest. Firstly, you may notice a partly hidden "safe" (locker) in Farrel's house. If you try to open it, he'll tell you to scram. (If you try it again he'll turn hostile, but it's empty so don't bother.) Go to Cornelius and tell him Farrel is keeping the watch in his safe; they'll have a fight, and you'll have completed the quest for no xp and quite a reputation drop. Useless. The other way is to get the watch, return it to Cornelius and say Farrel had stolen it. This is worth 500 xp.</p><aside class="red"><p>If you're taking advantage of the barter trick (see <a href="#quest-arroyo3">Obtain flint to have Mynoc sharpen your spear</a>) or the Bag bug to keep the watch, you can get xp for both quests by "giving" it to Farrel first, then going to Cornelius to reactivate the quest and handing it to him as well.

You won't find Jonny in Modoc (see Ghost Farm) but there's a minor diversion here. Go to the town well, remove the boards and use a Rope on the well. Climb down. On the ground here are a few coins (you trade in 1 karma for each coin... neither the karma amount nor the gold matters, so I'd take it just because you can) and, in the north end, a BB Gun. You can now return to Balthas and say you found Jonny's gun down the well, after which he'll believe Jonny is dead (plus he takes the gun, which is worth $300 fully loaded, so maybe this is not a good idea).</p><p>If you are Accepted in Modoc or better when you get the quest, Balthas will tell you to take Jonny's dog <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a> along with you (he'll join even if you're at the NPC limit).

This means you can't talk to him to drop him off (if he was in your party) or recruit him (if he wasn't, but he'll still join you if you did this before getting the quest). He'll also woof whenever you talk to him with the BB Gun in your inventory.

One is to walk over to the building and step on the carpet in the middle of the room, whereupon you'll fall 15 feet into a cave where you're greeted by some armed guards.

It's not really a nice place, but that's no reason to start shooting people. The two people in the Greeting Office are completely useless, by the way. In here you'll also find Ben Wade who runs a caravan of medical supplies to Redding on the 1st of every even month and will pay you $1000 to accompany him. In a locker you find what is probably your first Geiger Counter; you can loot these specific containers in broad daylight.</p><aside class="green"><p>Vault City is a good example of a place where people will tell you to stay away from lockers, shelves etc. But it doesn't hurt to try once!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>This is one of two places in the game (New Reno being the other) where most people will have new things to say after you complete the game. You'll have access to the inner city and the vault even if you didn't before. This also means that unexplored quest options may be cut off as key figures only respond to you with floats or new dialogue. Randal's Amenities shop effectively shuts down, but you can steal stuff from him safely if you really must have something: just click on him until he stops talking and then loot him clean (this is the same bug that befalls Salvatore in New Reno).</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>Once you get to this part of the world map (if not sooner), money and bartering will become less balanced than it has been. Up until now you haven't always been able to trade for everything you wanted, right? Well, shortly your pecuniary problems should be no more. Just hang around till you get a random encounter like "merchant party fending off raiders", "raiders fending off raiders", "raiders being butchered by a mantis", or the like. Once the fight begins, get out of the way and wait until there are only a few people left to kill, then kill the rest if you don't like them. Loot the corpses for stuff like Combat Shotguns, H&K CAWS's or Assault Rifles, and from this point on you should be able to trade for <em>anything</em> you ever want in a shop, even with Barter at 30% or lower. Of course, you can also choose to run from such encounters for the opposite reason, that you don't want to spoil the balance just yet.</p></aside><p>In a house by the brahmin pen you find Vic's old friend Ed.

South of the bar you find Curtis who lost his doll. The doll can be found behind a wall just to the north. When you return to Curtis you can either rip it up or give it back (100 xp in either case), but if you give it to him you can listen to his "dialogue" and go dig up a Wrench from under a pile of rocks a little further up. This will come in handy quite soon.</p><aside class="green"><p>Sean Meskill notes: "After bartering with Happy Harry (you needn't make a purchase), a bunch of stuff will be dumped into his 'stealable' inventory and you can then pinch whatever you please." This stuff represents a selection of his normal shop inventory; he only gets it once, but will keep it unless you relieve him of it. Additionally, the Micro Fusion Cell and Leather Armor Mark II in his shop inventory do not restock.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 Harry's inventory was kept in one of the shelves, and you could take it if you passed a Steal check, but failure would mean mortal combat.</p></aside><p><a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> is the owner of the bar.

Finally you get 100 xp more when he stands up and thanks you.</p><aside class="green"><p>Kwiatmen666: "As long as Puking Charlie lies on the ground you can keep using RadAways on him getting 100 xp each time."</p></aside><p>Nearby is a doctor who'll patch you up for money, though I doubt anyone would find his prices reasonable: between $225 and $500 for HP and crippled limbs except for eye damage, healing for one NPC (same ones as for Dr Troy below minus the <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a>) costs between $150 and $500 depending on how hurt the main character is, if you have more than one NPC this amount is tripled no matter how many of them are hurt, with CH 6 or Barter 75% you can take $100 off the price or $300 for multiple NPCs. The autodoc doesn't work too well and will malfunction 50% of the time when you pay for healing, which means you lose your money for nothing. Using Repair to fix the autodoc for 100 xp puts an end to this, and in fact you should do so or you could run into problems later, but you might also want to leave it as it is for a while. Andrew can also perform some other services. If you got the extra toes from the Toxic Caves goo, you can have them removed here for $500 ($300 with a discount), and in your inventory you get a Mutated Toe, which has a "use" at the end of the game. More to follow...</p><aside class="green"><p>A bug: if you have only one NPC and have the <a href="#car">Car</a>, you won't be able to ask for healing for the NPC.

This also happens if you return to the Toxic Caves and step in the goo after having the toes removed. This can be repeated indefinitely and you get a new Mutated Toe each time. Don't use the Toe on yourself or any party member since it will lower your Maximum Hit Points for some time, though not permanently.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The autodoc will never malfunction for a stupid character. Also you can get two special perks here. After you purchase healing, you get the option to "ride agin"; select this and you gain the Autodoc Raised hit points perk which gives +2 to max HP. However, for each time you "ride the autodoc" after that, you gain a level of the perk Autodoc Lowered hit points which gives -2 HP instead. Also beware that these are bugged; if you click them on your character sheet the game will immediately crash. <em>Sébastien Caisse</em> adds: "What's really stupid is that the script which gives you the bonus checks your IN, and if you have IN 10, then you get +4 instead of +2... but, um... you need IN 3 or less to get the 'ride agin' prompt..." There goes the Autodoc Raised hit points II perk, I suppose.</p></aside><p>Once you learn about combat implants from the medical database in the vault, you can return here and ask "Doctor" Andrew about them. The two kinds of dermal implants both add 5% to your Damage Resistance against normal and explosion damage. The two kinds of phoenix implants both raise your Damage Resistance to plasma, laser and fire weapons by 5%. Each Enhancement (which requires the you got the basic implant of that kind) will also lower your CH by 1 permanently, which I generally feel is not worth it until late in the game (plus those are really expensive). Here's what each implant will cost you (discount with CH 6 or Barter 75%):</p><dl><dt>Dermal Impact Armor</dt><dd>$7000 ($5000), 2 days.</dd><dt>Dermal Impact Asslt. Enhance.</dt><dd>$40,000 ($30,000), 5 days, CH -1.</dd><dt>Phoenix Armor Implants</dt><dd>$10,000 ($8000), 3 days (though he says two).</dd><dt>Phoenix Assault Enhancement</dt><dd>$50,000 ($40,000), 6 days, CH -1.</dd></dl><p>Each perk will also require you to part with a suit of normal Combat Armor; Combat Armor Mark II or Brotherhood Armor cannot be used for this purpose (this goes for getting the implants in Redding or San Francisco as well).</p><aside class="green"><p>If you didn't fix the autodoc before getting an implant, you die. Funny, huh?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Your CH variable can actually drop below 1, although it's never treated as anything less than 1. You'll notice this "debt" if you later raise your CH by means of Mentats, Gain Charisma or the like. Same thing goes if you lose your ear in New Reno.</p></aside><p>Wallace at the Customs Office will put the Den, Broken Hills and Redding on your world map.

This happens automatically if you talk to him with IN&lt;4.</li><li>Tell Wallace you're a trader. If you have any (Golden) Gecko Pelts, (Refined) Uranium Ore or a Gold Nugget in your inventory you can show them to him, or if you have any humanoid party members other than <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> you can simply claim you're about to sell them into slavery. You can then fork out $500 for a Day Pass.</li><li>Pickpocket Wallace for a Day Pass.</li><li>If you know of the Jet problem in Redding, ask Wallace about Redding and say you know why the shipments have slowed. He'll give you a Day Pass.</li><li>Talk to Skeev and buy False Citizenship Papers off him for $200 ($150 with Barter 50%), then threaten to expose him and he'll give you $300 back! This is by far the best option. You can turn him in to Wallace, but this requires giving up your False Citizenship Papers (with Speech 75% you can ask for a Day Pass in exchange).</li><li>Talk to Skeev with an IN&lt;4 character and you'll end up inside the vault as a "servant" (but you'll be able to leave without anyone reacting).</li><li>If you destroyed the Enclave you'll be allowed to enter, even if you were previously banned.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>The reason Wallace will see your vault suit under the Bridgekeeper's Robes is simply that the game forgets to check for it when determining if the character is "naked".

You'll be searched for drugs (Buffout, Psycho, Mentats or Jet) and alcohol (all 5 kinds). Also some people will throw you out if they find you after 6 p.m. With False Citizenship Papers you can enter without being searched and use the shop but not enter the vault. If you get a Day Pass from Wallace (in a legit manner) you can get new ones for $50 each should you need them, though I can't figure out a reason why you ever would. By the way, when entering using the False Citizenship Papers, don't make the mistake of calling the First Citizen a "he", or mentioning "all the vaults".</p><aside class="green"><p>As pointed out by Jaroslaw Zablotowicz, once you show the False Citizenship Papers to the gate guards and Randal you have no further need of them, even if you hand the papers over to Wallace.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p><a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> and/or <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> will not be allowed to enter the inner city unless you're Captain of the Guard.

The "Shamble off" option should always get you safely out of a conversation, though sometimes you can only choose between being thrown out or resisting. If you've had previous non-stupid dealings with them they may either treat you like any stupid character, or they may present you with no valid dialogue options, or they may just leave you be (Lydia will not call the guards on true citizens, for instance). There's a dialogue glitch when you talk to the gate guards for the first time: if you get two identical lines, the first leads to combat and the second ends dialogue.</p></aside><p>Go to the Information Center and lament the death of books for one Deans Electronics and one Big Book of Science (IN 7 or Comprehension needed).

Randal restocks every 3 days while the Sub-amenities shops restock every 2-3 days.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you kill any of the three shopkeepers here you don't get their goods.

The Sub-amenities shops will offer you lower prices if you're <em>not</em> a citizen. The reason for this is that the person who coded Vault City and New Reno apparently thought the signs of barter modifiers worked the other way around (which also means Randal's stuff was not really supposed to be cheap).</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 the Sub-amenities shopkeepers kept their wares in containers in the shops and if you had decent Steal you could loot them clean, though failing a check would net you first a warning and then banishment - even if the shopkeepers were invisible at the time!</p></aside><p>At the Servant Allocation Center you can sell some of your party members into slavery (<a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> for $250, <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> for $200, <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> for $100, <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> for $100, all doubled by a successful Barter check; Barkus will initially say he's offering $250 for <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> but it's a typo).

Don't flash False Citizenship Papers in his face or he'll have you expelled from Vault City forever. Don't push the matter of his harassing <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>, either... yet. He'll tell you about the raiders, and in fact, once you mention the raiders to him you have to offer to go find them, or he'll accuse you of being one and attack! Stark will also give you quests 9 and 10. If you want a free suit of Metal Armor, open the second locker from the top, standing behind it as seen from the nearby guard.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you become Captain of the Guard and talk to Stark with <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> in your party, you can order him to pardon <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> and pay him restitution. This will earn you $500 and 500 measly xp. If you're wondering how to become Captain this is described in the NCR section, <a href="#quest-vc3">Deliver a sample of jet to Dr. Troy</a>.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>After you become Captain you can also loot some containers that you couldn't before. The four buildings where you can do this are the Corrections Center, the small building opposite, the small building closest to the exit grid in the council area, and the Customs Office. You will notice that these containers are all watched by officials or guards in metal armor; regular citizens will not let you take their stuff.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There's a cheat you can use to enter the vault without citizenship. Move up close to the opening, enter combat mode and run onto the exit grid. It doesn't piss off the guards, either. "Hello Mr Evil Spy Marauder, no way you'll get past us, oh, except if you come barging like a homicidal maniac."</p></aside><p>If you move on to the third Vault City area, you'll find a few uninteresting buildings, a seemingly uninteresting bar and the Central Council. There are three people to see here: Gregory, McClure and Lynette. Gregory will issue the ridiculously difficult citizenship test. It <em>is</em> possible to pass and become a citizen right away, but you need to boost the right stats (PE 9, IN 9 and LK 9). The physical examination will disqualify you if you've grown extra toes in the Toxic Caves and didn't have them removed yet. You get 1000 xp if you pass the test.</p><p>McClure in the western room is the sane person in this outfit. Whenever you want something done, you go to him. The brave can take the other direction and turn right down the hall... Congratulations, you have found First Bitchizen Lynette, universally hated by <em>Fallout 2</em> gamers. If at any time you really piss her off, she's apt to ban you from Vault City permanently (like if you show her False Citizenship Papers; she'll promise you a Day Pass if you tell her who gave you the papers, but she's lying). Nevertheless you should get <a href="#quest-vc4">Resolve the problem with the nearby village</a> from her. McClure and Lynette can both put Gecko on your world map.</p><p>Once you learn of the Jet problem in Redding you can inform McClure of it for 250 xp. A large number of people in New Reno and Redding can tell you about this, but those who will let you report back to McClure are Dr Johnson, Ascorti, <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a>, Reed, Renesco, Little Jesus and Father Tully. After you get the Jet Antidote to Doc Johnson, again tell McClure about it for 2500 more xp. Don't ask him for a reward, however, or you don't get any xp, just $500.</p><p>If you have an exceptional Luck, go to the Parlour Room bar, order some alcohol-Z and keep doing so (weighing down the 2 key works fine). After you have bought 100 of them (costs $2000 in all; each one also heals 3 HP whereas if you order water it only heals 1 HP) you may gain a special perk that changes your Maximum Hit Points as follows (thanks to Geoffrey Bateman and <em>Sébastien Caisse</em> for the information):</p><dl><dt>LK 1</dt><dd>Alcohol Lowered hit points II (HP -4)</dd><dt>LK 2</dt><dd>Alcohol Lowered hit points (HP -2)</dd><dt>LK 9</dt><dd>Alcohol Raised hit points (HP +2)</dd><dt>LK 10</dt><dd>Alcohol Raised hit points II (HP +4)</dd></dl><p>Entering the vault, on level 1 you'll find the medical facilities. You'll want Doctor 75% to do everything here. First off, if you have that level of skill you can talk medicine with the doctor and he'll give you the Vault City Training perk which gives you +5% to Doctor and +5% to First Aid (see <a href="#quest-vc3">Deliver a sample of jet to Dr. Troy</a> first, though). After you've got the Vault City Training, if you come here to treat poisoning or radiation, you'll be able to ask for the Vault City Inoculations perk which gives you +10% Poison Resistance and +10% Radiation Resistance. Not that it's much to shout about, but every little bit helps. Dr Troy will offer free healing (HP, poison, radiation and crippled limbs except for eye damage), and if you're Captain you can also get him to heal NPCs except for <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a>, <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a>, the pariah dog or any inferior <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a>.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you become Captain of the Guard, you can bring <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> and <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> here without Dr Troy entering combat mode. If you let him heal <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>, you end up with some extra ammo: 20 7.62mm, 50 5mm JHP, 20 9mm ball, 24 10mm JHP, 10 .45 caliber, 40 .44 Magnum JHP, 40 .44 magnum FMJ and 50 .233 FMJ! Be careful not to talk to Lynette with either of them in your party, though... she'll throw you out of Vault City for good.</p></aside><p>Talking to nurse Phyllis you can do a lot of stuff:</p><ul><li>Convince Phyllis to see the outside world (choose the "similarity of citizens" path): 300 xp.</li><li>With Doctor 75% and PE 6 you can get Phyllis to talk to the doctor about potential sterility in Vault City (choose the "no children" path) for 300 xp.</li><li>Male characters only can date her for 100 xp if they have CH 6 and one of the following: Sex Appeal, Kama Sutra Master, CH 9 or Speech 75%.</li><li>Male characters only can donate a sperm sample in the no children thread. With IN 4 you get 50 xp, with IN 5-6 you get 250 xp, and with IN&gt;6 you get 500 xp. If you ask for a magazine you get a Cat's Paw Magazine!</li></ul><p>With Doctor 75% you can get information on combat implants from the medical database for 500 xp if you access it using Science. Search the database 22 more times. You'll get a new message. Search the database 30 more times. You'll get a new message. Then just 2 more times, and you get a "secret" message. The doctor here won't perform the implant surgery, but there are others who are less conscientious.</p><aside class="blue"><p>Generally you need a certain Science proficiency (51% here, though Doctor 76% will do as well) to use computers. Also if you don't have IN 4 you usually can't use them no matter how high your Science skill. Computers that can be used for something are almost always called something other than "computer" when you move the mouse pointer over them, like in this case "Vault City medical terminal", but there are exceptions.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you got the clue from the Magic 8-Ball (see New Reno), use the computer nearest to the entrance to gain 2 Stimpaks and 1 Super Stimpak.</p></aside><p>On level 2 of the vault, just pick the doors if needed (Lockpick 80% should do it) and loot the footlockers. Be sure to pick up the Computer Voice Module. The crates only contain Water Chips - which are, incidentally, an exception to the principle of "take everything". Maybe you'll want one for fun, but really there's no reason to bother. Two of the doors can only be opened with a ST of 8 or higher (7 if you use a Crowbar), which is kind of ironic, since behind one of them resides the Red Memory Module which will (much) later raise your ST. Take a couple of Buffouts if you have to, make sure not to get addicted. Or just come back here once you have the Power Armor, but there's some nice ammo to be had, so it's probably worth the chems to get it now.</p><p>Fix (Repair) the rattling vent for 100 xp and 50 Micro Fusion Cell. You need PE 6 to notice that it's rattling, or if you don't you can go to level 3 and wait until the central computer says that it's detected an obstruction in the ventilation system, then return to level 2.</p><p>On level 3, loot both the locker room and the armory for some juicy stuff. Go to the lowermost computer in the leftmost room and use Science on it for 350 xp. Do you remember that the other computer in that room could be used for the same purpose in <em>Fallout</em>? Well, in this vault you can't. But if you read the secret message in the medical database, this is where you'll go after accessing the central computer when you've completed the game. You'll then be able to use this terminal for 20,000 xp each time. Hm, pointless if you ask me.</p><p>On this floor you'll usually find Martin (though he will be on level 2 if you enter the vault between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m.), who's singing "Maybe". It's a good song, so don't tell him to stop. In fact, you can get infinite karma (+1 each time) if you compliment him on his singing.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you've entered the vault illegally or by being stupid you may want to stay away from the armory, since there's a bug that can trap you in there forever. This is the door that Martin is keeping an eye on, so if you try to open it, he'll "stop" you by entering combat mode. (He won't attack, but your NPCs may attack him!) To enter the room anyway, toggle Sneak mode, pick the door and open it, but oddly you cannot use the same method to get out. You can't get party members to open the door, either - they just pass through it like ghosts. Killing Martin or scaring him away does not help, since the actual bug is that the door checks if <em>it</em> sees you, not if Martin sees you. There are two ways to avoid this. One is simply being a citizen (which you'd normally be if you're inside the vault), in which case Martin won't stop you opening the door. Also if he's on level 2 it will be OK. The armory contains some guns (free 10mm SMG), grenades and ammo, but nothing important.</p></aside><p>The central computer is the talking one in the room to the right. Using it you get Vault 15 on your world map, and if you have PE 7 there is also a mysterious slot to plug in your Pip-Boy (you'll notice it when you log off the computer). Doing so gives you a "Vault City Travel Log" entry in your Pip-Boy and will put New Reno, Redding, Broken Hills, NCR and Vault 15 on your world map if they weren't there before. You must have noticed this slot to get the "desginer notes"and use the xp computer after finishing the game.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: Reaching into the computer will give you an electric shock and damage depending on your current Hit Points (it will never kill you, even if you're at 1 HP). Apparently this was also supposed to raise your Damage Resistance to electrical damage, but it doesn't. As long as you open the computer (you don't have to get shocked) you can get the travel log without the PE requirement.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="vault-city--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#vault-city--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-vc1"> <span>Deliver Moore's briefcase to Mr. Bishop in New Reno.</span></summary><p>Thomas Moore stands in the inner city preaching. If you play along, and providing Bishop is not dead, Moore will give you a briefcase to deliver to New Reno (which shows up on the map). If you happen to piss him off in conversation, you can always mollify him again unless you're a Slaver. Just don't ask him for payment or threaten to turn him in, or he'll put a note in the briefcase telling Bishop to kill you on arrival... which is bad. You get 500 xp and $250 for a successful delivery. Note that you <em>must</em> take this quest if you want to do missions for Bishop later.</p><aside class="green"><p>After you've made the delivery and learned Moore is an NCR agent, you can turn him in to Lynette for 500 xp. I see no problem with this since Moore is a fanatic, you don't lose any karma, and Bishop doesn't care. Just don't mention brahmin maulings or you won't be welcome in Vault City for much longer. If you're not a citizen you can only do this when you show Lynette Bishop's Holodisk.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>From the <em>Fallout Bible</em>: "Two Super Stimpaks should appear in Bishop's inventory after you deliver the right case." They do, too!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Slavers can actually get this quest providing they have CH 9 or Speech 96%.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-vc2"> <span>Get a plow for Mr. Smith.</span></summary><p>Smith lives in a tent in the north part of the Courtyard. He needs a plow which Harry is selling. Simply buy the plow for Smith ($800, $600 with Barter 51%) and he'll repay you with 250 xp, a Desert Eagle .44 and 20 .44 Magnum JHP. You can ask $150 from Smith in advance, but then you don't get the other reward so you can figure how good that is.</p></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-vc3"> <span>Deliver a sample of jet to Dr. Troy.</span></summary><p>Getting this quest is a little tricky. First you must have Doctor 75% so that you qualify for the medical tour. There are now two non-obvious dialogue paths that lead to this quest. Tell him that you're something of a doctor, and when he offers the tour, either try to leave conversation directly, or else take the tour, but directly afterwards leave conversation. (You can always take the tour later, but there's no reason not to do it right away.) In either case he'll stop you and ask if you, being an outsider, could do him a special service, namely smuggle some Jet into the vault (see <a href="#quest-vc7">Rescue Amanda's husband, Joshua</a> for details on how to do that). Give it to him for $1000 but no xp. If you have Jet in your inventory when you get the quest, you can ask $1200 for it with Barter 75%, or $1500 with Barter 95%; doing this will also provide you with an extra (inconsequential) line if you have Chem Reliant or are addicted to Jet. Anyway, if you return three months later he'll have churned out two doses of Jet Antidote for you, which you should take to Doc Johnson in Redding; see that section for the rest.</p><p>The time needed for the doctor to produce the antidote on his own can be shortened to one month if you've talked to <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> about Jet production; when handing over the Jet, start the dialogue thread that begins "you don't want to inhale that crap". If you have <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> with you at this point the two of them will compare notes, but it's not necessary. For this you get 750 xp. However, you cannot get these xp if you have the New Reno quest active, so you should first do this and then talk to <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> to get the New Reno quest before Dr Troy can make an antidote to maximize your xp.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you tell Dr Troy you're Captain of the Guard he sensibly won't ask you to smuggle Jet for him.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There's also an unlikely way to get only 500 xp and shorten the time needed to make the antidote to two months. For this you must talk to <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> about Jet <em>before</em> he joins you, and leave dialogue once he says "And that's all yer ever gonna learn" (you need some IN and Science to get there). Then go to Troy and hand him the Jet without having <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> in your party.</p></aside><p>Instead of taking the quest, you can blackmail Troy for $500 each month ($1000 with Barter 75%, if you press him for more he'll call the guards). If you do, don't ever go to him for medical treatment or you'll get hit for 6999 Hit Points or so... but you also get some really funny dialogue. 🙂 If you don't like him much you can turn him in to Lynette and he'll be removed from Vault City (you must be a citizen or Lynette will remove you instead). You can't talk to Phyllis any more if you do this.</p><aside class="green"><p>You won't get this quest if you've already told him about the endorphin blockers after talking to <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a>, so do all this in the right order, OK? In case you're not sure which that is, see <a href="#quest-vc7">Rescue Amanda's husband, Joshua</a> in New Reno.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 you would always be offered this quest after leaving dialogue with Dr Troy for the first time. It was supposed to be like that in the updated script as well, but a little bug snuck in (gasp).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Jet Antidote is slightly bugged. Firstly, if you are addicted to Jet when you use it, you don't lose the dose. Secondly, you can use it to raise your stats permanently, although this is a pointless kind of cheating. In any case here's one way of doing it which works for me most of the time. All you need is a supply of Jet and one Jet Antidote. Step 1: use 2 or more Jet, making sure you get addicted, then 1 Jet Antidote. Step 2: rest for 24 hours (the game will exit from the Pip-Boy automatically). Step 3: repeat step 1. Step 4: rest for a few days, then check your stats. For every repetition of the cycle after the first, your ST and PE should go up by 1 and your AP by 1 or 2.

Joe sends you to Happy Harry to buy them, and then you can return with the weapons for 800xp. If your speech skill is bad you will have to pay full prize for the weapons ($10,000), but at 50% you should have a good chance to break even.

Joe will refer you to Councilman McClure, and also tell you some ghouls might be behind the problem. If you ask Connar about the rats he will tell you the same thing, and also give you one of the amulets if you want. Talk to McClure and tell him you think you can get rid of the mole rats by finding out who controls them. When you promise that, he will postpone Vault City's raid on the village with an extra month (so you've got a month + whatever time left of what Stark gave you).</p><p>In the Gecko junkyard, find the hole in the back to the hidden home of the 'Brain' rat.

She wants you to convince trader Robert Baron to make this happen. There's a few ways to accomplish this. You can talk him into it (easy speech roll), pay him $500 (easy barter roll, $1000 if you fail), or use good old intimidation (strength 7, he turns hostile if you have less). If you are married you can offer <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> to sleep with him instead or if you play as a female character you can do it yourself (charisma 7).

Although the people in Vault City babble about radiation, you really don't have to take any Rad-X while you're here. Nor are the ghouls vicious killers. In my first game I was a little scared going here for the first time. 🙂</p><aside class="red"><p>Well, it was a little more dangerous in v1.0 because of a bug that would make some ghouls attack you unprovoked, ruining your chances of finishing quests in Gecko. Jeremy Lowe: "There are three (in my experience) who do this: one of the ghouls in the first shack on the right as you enter the junkyard; a ghoul lurking behind the Harp bar (makes it very tricky to get into the plant); and a ghoul guard in the power plant - he's the one in the long corridor beside the entrance to the reactor core proper." Tim Weber chips in: "I don't know about the first two ghouls, but the last one, near the reactor core, will always attack me whenever I contact the Enclave on the computer. Other than that he just leaves me alone. (Unless of course I cause a meltdown, but that's hardly surprising.)" When I tested it myself the two nameless glowing ones in the reactor building would enter combat, and also the guard in the long corridor if I did the Enclave thing. The bug is caused by incorrect variable assignment, so there's no telling what will set off any particular ghoul.</p></aside><p>At the Harp, Wooz will give you a free pack of "Tragic" cards if you get him to tell you about the game. You can play with him if you like; each game will either cost you or win you one pack of cards. You can win with a pretty low Gambling skill, but it's not really worth the time.</p><p><a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> the doctor (standing about with Harold in the building marked Manager's Office) will heal you: HP and crippled limbs except for eye damage, NPCs except for <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a>, the pariah dog or any inferior <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a>, charges nothing if you have no money or if you talked to him about your ancestor the Vault Dweller, else just a nominal fee.

Doing so gives you +5 karma and makes you more liked in Gecko, so go for it even if you're dropping him off directly afterwards.</p><p>In the power plant, you'll need a yellow and a red keycard to pass the first door you encounter marked with each of these colors. The guard directly ahead of you as you enter has both, if you want to steal them, else you can just pick them up from various containers. Percy has a Yellow Pass Key in his house for the taking. You'll find a blue one as well, but it has no use... in this location.</p><aside class="red"><p>For some funny comments, try to Sneak past some ghouls in the plant.</p></aside><p>Percy in the junkyard has a shop with very fair prices (restocks every 3 days) and will also give you <a href="#quest-gecko5">Find Woody the ghoul for Percy</a> below. Skeeter will upgrade weapons (see table in the Items section) and in the leftmost room of his house you'll find what is quite possibly your first set of Lockpicks.

This must be done before anything else you choose to do with the reactor.

Also, if you give him a radioactive drink he will start to glow, and if you give him a radaway he will stop (this also works with the old <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> model).</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="gecko--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#gecko--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-gecko1"> <span>Solve the Gecko powerplant problem.</span></summary><p>Talk to Harold to get this quest in Gecko. (No matter if you get it here or in VC it pops up for both towns in your Pip-Boy.) First off, the <em>evil</em> way of finishing this, which includes blowing up the power plant. There are three ways to do this, all of which require you to go to the room next to the reactor room:</p><ul><li>Firstly, the way of the robot. Access the computer and initialize it using the codes containing the letters A, B and C in that order. Next you'll have to figure out how to operate the robot. Choose the coolant maintenance sequence, read the instructions on how to operate the robot, then enter a program. If you don't want to use trial and error, the correct sequence corresponds to the order of the planets starting with the outmost and going inwards... and if <em>that</em> doesn't mean anything to you, examine the machinery around the rim of the reactor and direct the robot to each one in turn. Then add the command to shut the coolant valve. Once the robot accomplishes this, you get 550 xp and turn all the ghouls in the plant hostile!</li><li>Next, the way of the seriously radiated. Instead of using the robot you could walk over to the valve and shut it yourself, but you and any party members take 10 damage for each few steps you take in the reactor room. You need to use the valve three times to shut it (with a ST check for each attempt), after which you'll take 15 damage instead. Not really recommended... and taking Rad-X will not alleviate the damage, only protect you from being permanently radiated. Plus you get no xp.</li><li>Finally, the way of the devious is to simply hand the Clipboard with the coolant report to Hank, and the dumbass will do your work for you. Plus, you can get the hell out of there while he lumbers over to the coolant valve. You get 550 xp for this also.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>While you're fiddling with the computer, there's a great sequence which is rather easy to miss. Choose the option to "Initiate general maintenance sequence", and try to download the code (you need Science 50% for this). Enter the codes with the letters X, Y and Z in that order, then choose "List other stations" and "More". Choose any of the first two dialogue options, and look... a talking head! You can have a great time chatting with this dude, but it doesn't actually do anything (i.e. no gunships show up with gatlings blazing or anything).</p></aside><p>After you've started the meltdown, you and your party members (except <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>) will take hits from radiation as you battle your way out (unless you managed to run out while Hank or the robot was going to the valve). There's no time limit; you can actually stay for as long as you want, providing you can handle the damage and radiation. You get another 2500 xp when you leave the reactor, which is now impossible to re-enter (it's not as if you'd want to). Ghouls in the town outside will only attack if you talk to them, and named ghouls like Skeeter, Harold or Wooz don't turn hostile at all - unless you start fighting other ghouls nearby. 24 hours afterwards everyone in Gecko will be gone, including <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> if he was there but not in your party (taking with him any equipment he was carrying), but excepting Lumpy and the dogs in the junkyard. Congratulations, you are evil.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you leave the map while Hank is going to the valve, the plant is destroyed but you don't get the extra 550 xp. This also happens if you enter the robot commands in the order 2, 4, 1, 5, 3 (note that this is the wrong order, it's a bug) and send the robot on its way, even though it never reaches the valve.</p></aside><p>If instead you want to do good, then you'll have learned from Harold that all the reactor needs is a good hydrospheratic magnulator or something of the like. Return to Vault City... but <em>don't</em> tell Lynette the good news, or she'll ban you from VC forever (did I mention she likes doing that?). Instead talk to McClure and he'll tell you to get the hydramagolator from Randal in the Amenities shop. If you have the Gecko Holodisk you'll be giving it to McClure at this time (see <a href="#quest-gecko2">Optimize the power-plant</a> below). Go to Randal and pick up the part (animated picture, cool). Once you get back to the Gecko plant there are again three ways of installing the part:</p><ul><li>Run like heck through the reactor room, taking 10 damage every few steps, use the part on the machinery with the red wheel (Repair check) for 4000 xp, then run like heck out of there. This is still kinda dumb.</li><li>Talk to Festus. He's dubious, so you must make a Speech check to get him to install the part for 4250 xp.</li><li>Go through the robot procedure, same program as before except the last step is installing the part instead of shutting off the coolant valve. 4500 xp for this.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>As above you can enter the commands in the incorrect order 2, 4, 1, 5, 3 and then leave the plant to fix it for 4000 xp, providing the robot has the part. No point in this, of course, but this is the nearly ultimate guide so there you have it.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you fiddled with the robot controls before getting the Hydroelectric Part, you must choose "Back" and "Initiate Repair Sequence" for the part to be transferred to the robot.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Note that after you've gone through all that trouble to fix the plant, you can still use the robot or manual way of turning off the coolant valve for 550 more xp (if you used the robot) and 2500 xp for blowing up the plant. Similarly you can sabotage the plant and then use the Hydroelectric Part for 4000 xp (manual) or 4500 xp (robot) before the plant blows up.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>From Sebastian Cassten: "If you let Festus install the Hydroelectric Part for you and use the barter trick to keep it, you can afterwards do the 'running way' and get 4000 xp more." If the plant is already optimized when you do this, it will be un-optimized and you'll be able to do that entire quest all over again.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Leaving the power plant while the robot is still walking can cause it to get stuck. In this case you can go into the reactor and steal the part from the robot, or kill it, and do the repairing yourself.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Go to Harold after fixing the plant, ask him what he does and tell him of your ancestor. He'll give you 3 Super Stimpaks and 5 Stimpaks. You can only access this thread once, so make sure you follow the conversation right up to the end. Also if you ever got into <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>'s thread about the G.E.C.K. ("Vault 13 owes us one") then you won't get the Stimpaks, because the same variable is used to determine if you've been through either thread.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-gecko2"> <span>Optimize the powerplant.</span></summary><p>Obviously you can only finish this is if you installed the part instead of shutting down the reactor. After you've fixed the reactor, talk to Festus again and he'll give you a Reactor Holodisk to take to the Vault City central computer. Since you fixed the plant McClure will make you a citizen, so you'll have access to the vault. If you talk to McClure about optimizing the reactor before telling him you repaired it, he'll have the data optimized for you, saving you the trip into the vault. In any case, return to Festus with the optimized disk and use it on the reactor computer for 2500 more xp.</p><p>There's another way you can go about this for a few more xp. In the junkyard, go down the manhole in the shack to the left of the abandoned reactor building and you'll find a few access tunnels guarded by ghouls. There's a tough ghoul named Zomak standing by the entrance to the cave, who has some stuff for thieves to steal. In the back of the cave you find The Brain, a mutated mole rat who plans to take over the world. Sound familiar? Just go along with whatever he says and he'll give you a Talisman (which doesn't do anything) and tell you to talk to Gordon about optimization data. This tunnel crawl isn't strictly necessary since Gordon will give you the Gecko Holodisk even if you don't speak to the rat at all, providing you talk to him before you repair the reactor (or after you optimize it, but then you'd have scant use for the disk).</p><aside class="green"><p>If you carry any Cheezy Poofs in your inventory, the rat won't talk to you until you've given him all of them to eat. If you refuse to part with them, he'll attack. If you've killed Keeng Ra'at, The Brain will muse upon the passing of his "sole remaining kin" the first time you initiate dialogue.</p></aside><p>Anyway, when you talk to Gordon he'll do Gordon Gekko's routine from <em>Wall Street</em>, and you can agree to bring the aforementioned disk to someone in Vault City. McClure is the obvious choice here; you get 750 xp for handing it to him. You can go to The Brain after all this is done but he has nothing useful to say. Gordon will give you another holodisk after you talk to the Brain if you got the first one without having done so.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you talk to McClure about the Gecko Holodisk after you fix the plant but before you talk to Festus about optimization, you end up not giving the disk to McClure. You must then get the Reactor Holodisk from Festus before you can make another attempt. Note that you'll miss out on the 750 xp if you optimize the data before giving the Gecko Holodisk to McClure (for a non-citizen, carrying the Gecko Holodisk when you hand him the Reactor Holodisk is enough).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you got two Gecko Holodisks from Gordon (bug), you can give both of them to McClure (also bug). If you're not a citizen, you have to give the first one to him when you tell him about the needed part, and the second when you give him the Reactor Holodisk. The other way is to show him a Gecko Holodisk after fixing the plant and becoming a citizen, but before getting the Reactor Holodisk from Festus. After you get the Reactor Holodisk, McClure will take both Gecko Holodisks off your hands. (In fact, at this point you can exploit the Bag bug and hand him any number of disks.) Just don't keep both in your inventory when you hand him the first one, since he'll take all you have.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 you can complete this quest by taking the Reactor Holodisk straight to the terminal without bothering to analyse the data.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>If you optimize the plant you sort of condemn the ghouls... since then you get the bad ending for Gecko, where VC annex them to gain full control of the power plant. To get the "neutral" ending, fix but don't optimize the plant. See Endings for more details.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-gecko3"> <span>Get super repair kit for Skeeter.</span></summary><p>Ask Skeeter in the junkyard about car parts, and he'll trade you a Fuel Cell Controller (the thing needed to run the <a href="#car">Car</a> in the Den) for a Super Tool Kit.

If you already have the kit he asks you for it right away. 250 xp is in this. If you kill him the part will appear on his body and the other ghouls won't care.</p><aside class="red"><p>Before the patch, you could steal the car part from Skeeter, but then again, before the patch you could get the <a href="#car">Car</a> without the Controller, as well.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-gecko4"> <span>Get 3-step plasma transformer for Skeeter.</span></summary><p>Skeeter will ask for this when you bring him the Tool Kit, if at the time you are carrying at least one weapon that he can upgrade.

If you ask Festus for it, you can make up any of four excuses and get it if you pass a Speech check or if he likes you; you can also steal it off him, if you like that better... or barter for it. Whatever. Return to Skeeter and he'll give you 350 xp and a free weapon upgrade, which means you should get the .44 Magnum (Speed Load). Yum! If you don't want to wait for Skeeter to give you the quest, just bring the part to him (you can get it from Jeremy without having the quest active).</p><aside class="green"><p>You can actually steal the part and then get one more for each Requisition Form... and Skeeter will perform one free upgrade for each one.

The first time you come here you end up by the manhole</p><p>if you pass a difficult Outdoorsman check or if you read the Raiders Map, else you will find yourself outside the cave opening.</p><aside class="red"><p>If you finish the game and wonder why there's an unused button on the world map screen, it's supposed to be the Raiders button. Before the patch it did show up, but mislabelled "Arroyo". It seems they didn't quite manage to fix it.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Notice how the raider base as well as Broken Hills happen to be on a beeline between Vault City and NCR, in approximately the same way that Modoc is on a beeline between the Den and Vault City, Redding is on a beeline from the Den to New Reno, and Shady Sands was on a beeline between Vault 13 and Vault 15 in <em>Fallout</em>...?</p></aside><p>If you start out by the cave opening, go inside. Three of the passages here are lavishly mined. Use Traps on the floor plates for 25 xp each, or step on one and start a chain reaction if you don't have the patience (you can also set them off by dropping explosives). All nearby mines won't necessarily be triggered in this case. There's a lot of them, but they don't do much damage. Beware that the middle lower passage has a mine which cannot be disarmed, and your party members seem to love treading on it.</p><p>Also look out for four invisible pitfalls. With a good PE you can spot them before you fall down (giving you a few points of damage), but unlike the floor traps the pitfalls won't automatically make you stop when you notice them, so unless you usually move a hex or two at a time you're probably going to fall down anyway. Below is another cave which holds giant scorpions (tougher than your average radscorpion) and many miscellaneous items (Hunting Rifle, Leather Armor among other things) strewn on the floor among the bones. There's also a pile of rocks like the one you got the Wrench from in Vault City, but nothing happens when you manipulate it. Take the ladder to go back up again.</p><p>Northeast of here you find the actual base, and this is also the map you arrive on if you go down the manhole. If you come from the direction of the mined caves, there are two more rows of mines to deal with, as well as a chainlink fence with two locked doors in it. The first time you set foot on this map, you get 500 xp and can now return to Vault City to report you found the raider camp. Wallace will give you a Day Pass if you aren't a citizen, but Stark will just send you to Lynette and Lynette will just ask you to go back and kill the raiders.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you go down the manhole and back up again, your <a href="#car">Car</a> will be gone, but don't worry. Just leave the area, access the town map and go to the cliff, and the <a href="#car">Car</a> will be there. This is one of several bugs that the patch readme file claims were fixed but which weren't.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Fighting the raiders will be a lot easier if you approach from the well. Just show yourself in the narrow opening to the main room, and they'll come running for you. Run back behind the nearest corner, then forego your turn repeatedly. <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> or someone can stand there shooting them to bits at point blank range with a Combat Shotgun, while they ignore him and pile up in the narrow passage trying to reach you; this also works to some extent for an HtH party. If you approach from behind the fence you'll have a hard time keeping the raiders from sniping you with their FN FALs. However, if <em>you</em> have a Scoped Hunting Rifle and Small Guns 150% or so, feel free to snipe right back from where they can't get to you.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Although there have been rumours that you don't always have to fight the raiders, this is not true.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>When you tell Lynette you found or wiped out the raiders, you can demand money for your information if you're a citizen: $100, $200, $400 or $500. This is pretty bad, though. Firstly, if your Barter skill is not up to what you ask, Lynette will have you expelled from the city and revoke your citizenship. Secondly, you can't ask on both occasions, so the most you can get out of it is $500. Thirdly, if you do this she won't give you the usual reward of $1000 (and 1000 xp) when you destroy the raiders. Well, this somehow seems like familiar CRPG behaviour.</p></aside><p>There's a native standing around named Shadow-Who-Walks. This is the native guide Stark was talking about. He won't necessarily join the battle right away, and it's possible to keep him alive and neutral through the entire encounter, although he says nothing and does nothing anyway. Well, actually he does say something if you click on him 30-50 times for a secret message.</p><aside class="red"><p>A rumour says that it was originally meant to be much harder to find the raider camp, which makes a lot of sense given how Stark talks about it being nigh on impossible. Supposedly you'd either have to find Bishop's map, or perform a quest involving this tribal guide somehow. Designer <em>Chris Avellone</em> has said that you were supposed to be able to talk Shadow-Who-Walks out of helping the raiders and thus "break their strength" (see below) without having to fight them.</p></aside><p>In the northwestern part of the map there are three "merc leaders", having the combat armor look, each of them standing in front of a locked container with Dog Tags in them. Collect all three and go to the safe. First of all, examine it for traps, and if your Traps skill is decent (50% will do if you save first and try a few times) you can disarm the trap for a stick of Dynamite. Next use the numbers on the Dog Tags (just keep all three in your inventory) to open the safe for 500 xp. With Luck 9 it's possible to open the safe without the combination. In there you'll find amongst other things an Account Book, which you should hold on to.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can only open the safe by repeatedly "twisting its nose" (LK 9). You can't disarm the trap, but you can set it off by dropping some explosives of your own next to it.</p></aside><p>Once you leave the barracks map after having killed most of the raiders (leaving four or less alive), you'll get a message saying you've broken their strength and 2000 xp. This means there'll be no more raider encounters in the area. You can now return to Vault City... Wallace and Stark just tell you to go to Lynette, but she'll reward you with 1000 xp and $1000 for wiping out the raiders, and if you have the Account Book with you, show her that for another 1000 xp and $500.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you left any raiders alive in the base when you get the 2000 xp, they die and you don't get any xp for them (though you can loot their corpses), so make sure you finish them all off before leaving the map. This includes Shadow-Who-Walks. Maybe they get so angry they have a collective aneurysm.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have Bishop's Holodisk you can't show it to Lynette until after you give her the Account Book. Importantly, if you have <em>both</em> the book and the disk in your inventory when you report back to Lynette, you miss out on the reward for finding the Account Book and skip directly to Vault City <a href="#quest-vc6">Deliver Lynette's holodisk to Westin in NCR</a>. So drop the Holodisk first.</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="broken-hills">Broken Hills <a class="header-link" href="#broken-hills">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/broken-hills-997b919c.jpg"></picture><blockquote><p>Sometimes I feel like a magic 8-ball. I just spout random sayings and walk away.</p><footer><cite>Broken Hills resident</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Broken Hills is one of the two mining towns in this game, unique when it comes to the way that humans, ghouls and mutants live together. If you put away your weapons, you can talk to Steve the town greeter and learn a few things. The first time you arrive here in the <a href="#car">Car</a>, you'll hit poor Lumpy who gives you a reference to a special encounter in <em>Fallout</em>.</p><p>Liz runs the general store. If you have negative karma you can ask her what there is around to kill; if you get a bad reaction and annoy her she won't talk to you at all. Characters with high Steal can attempt to simply pick her table clean. She has some minor stuff in her basement (four containers with weapons, including a Combat Shotgun), but she won't let you go down there to begin with. With a good Sneak skill you can do it anyway (the check is harder at night whether Liz is actually in the room or not). To get into the basement with her permission, go to Phil's place, buy stuff and tip him for a total of $20 (because of a bug the tips aren't deducted from your money), whereupon he reveals the secret of the weapons cache. Return to Liz, ask about the weapons and tell her you heard about them from a reliable source. Then tell her you'll use the weapons on the mutants and she'll let you take them.</p><aside class="green"><p>If when you ask Liz about the stash you choose the "it's all over town" line, you'll get stuck in dialogue mode. This is a serious bug that happens because the script tries to start a fight when you're still in dialogue. You can press 1 and Esc to exit, but you'll have to shut down the game entirely before you can play normally again. This also happens if you tell her "You" when she asks what you had in mind to kill, or if you fail a Speech check after giving her the "reliable source" line (save often!).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Liz restocks every 2-4 days, while Bill, Jacob and Holliday all restock every 3 days. For the latter three, prices will be significantly lower (50% in the case of Bill and the doctor) if you ask them to barter in dialogue instead of hitting the barter button. John L. Hunter points out that Liz's table restocks even after she is killed, though you still need Steal 25-30% to access it.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: Every time you trade with Liz, she takes a tenth of your money afterwards and calls it a "service charge". How's that for charity? Jacob only takes a small "tip". You need IN 2 to ask them to trade, but even if you have IN 1 you can get around this simply by pressing the barter button, which also circumvents the service charge. This means you have to pay their expensive rate, of course, but a stupid character wouldn't get Jacob's cheap rate anyway.</p></aside><p><a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> the mutant sheriff will join your party after you complete quests 1 and 2. You get 1000 xp for this, plus you can always grab his Minigun and stuff if you're not bringing him.</p><p>Talk to Bill if you want to work as a caravan guard on routes to Vault City (on the 21st each month), NCR (on the 11th) and Gecko (on the 1st). These caravan jobs suck compared to the ones in Redding, since you get only $200 per job, plus there are no return caravans, effectively leaving you stranded. For general behaviour of caravans, see Redding. Should Chad get killed or if you abandon a caravan, you don't get paid and there will be no more caravans. If you choose to shovel brahmin crap, you get $100 each time, and after you've done it five times you get the Expert Excrement Expeditor special perk which gives you +5% to Speech and 500 xp. Bill will also sell stuff.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You only get to shovel crap once (need IN 2 for this), so you don't get the perk.</p></aside><p>Talk to Doc Holliday and listen to the story of his life. You'll get free healing from him (HP and damaged limbs except for eyes, same NPCs as Dr Troy in Vault City except he'll heal <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a> instead of <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a> and <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a>), and also learn that he knows a certain Dr Fung in San Francisco, which is useful info. You can also get free healing if you ask what he does and banter a little, but you can only do that once, whereas you can get him to talk about his life over and over again. If for some reason you pay for healing he'll charge between $50 and $300 for each person. He'll sell you Stimpaks and stuff, and takes only half the price if you ask him to trade instead of hitting the barter button.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you have the <a href="#car">Car</a> you won't be able to ask for party healing if you only have one NPC, but if you get the free healing he'll heal everyone anyway.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: Each time you pay for healing it costs $100 but you don't get healed, which is probably a bug (or is this old man really... evil?).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Only two containers on the western map have anything in them (except for the hidden footlockers, see below): one bookcase in <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>' house which holds a Rubber Doll, and the small pot outside the house on the top right which holds a Cat's Paw. (Obviously these are for Typhon, along with the Rotgut from the bar.) The containers on the eastern Broken Hills map are <em>all</em> empty - the only item lying around is the Fuzzy Painting in Eric's house. Lazy, lazy level designers!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>On the subject of "cheating within the workings of the game"... By the exit grid where you arrive in town, position your character between the exit and the the fence to the north, on the hex which is half offscreen. Then click on the other side of the fence and you'll end up there. Now, in the upper left corner of the map you'll find a few footlockers whose contents you can grab if you want to. They contain, from left to right: nothing, Jacob's stock, Holliday's stock and Bill's stock. All of them reset to full every three days, too, even Jacob's after you put him in jail. If the exit grid causes you trouble, instead go directly south, then work your way past the brahmin pen and the houses by clicking on the ground further away on the map. This way you can skirt around the map on the "outside" to reach the footlockers, even bypassing the exit grid on the right. The empty box is actually used for temporarily storing a shopkeeper's usual inventory while you're trading with them. As pointed out by John L. Hunter, you can stuff armed explosives into this box, then run quickly back and talk to a shopkeeper; after you leave dialogue they'll carry the explosives. Could be of interest if you want to try a really crazy assassination technique.</p></aside><p>Talk to Typhon in the eastern part of town. Give him a Cat's Paw and wait one hour. Give him a Rubber Doll and wait for three hours. Give him a bottle of Rot Gut and he'll give you a clue as to where his hidden treasure might be. You also gain 2000 xp. The next part is purely optional. Go to the town well and manipulate it. You find the treasure, but it falls down the well, and you're too big to go down there. How appropriate that a small treasure hunter is just nearby! Talk to Micky and he goes down to retrieve... 10,000 Bottle Caps. Useless. And no, you can't get Micky back up again.</p><p>Dan, the worried spouse, is in the house northeast of the Old Ghouls' Home. Agree to look for his wife (charging him if you want to), then after you've found the dead bodies in <a href="#quest-bh2">Find the missing people for Marcus</a>, return to Dan and break the news to him in whichever way you choose for 500 xp. If you're evil, you can take his $500 and then tell him you're not going to look for her after all. This will not make you popular.</p><p>If you talk to the mad Professor in the lab coat, you can take Agility, Perception or Intelligence tests against his artificially smartened radscorpion. Take the AG and PE tests first for 500 xp each. You can match the scorpion with very low stats although you may have to try several times (it's impossible to actually outperform it). It turns out you can't win the IN test because the scorpion "cheats" at chess (or maybe it really is smarter). Time to look elsewhere for guidance. If you go to the field to the north you may notice a talking spore plant trying to draw your attention. Rrright. If you bring a Shovel you can help the plant by moving it to the Old Ghouls' Home for 1000 xp, and the plant will tell you how to beat the scorpion at chess. Return to the doctor and defeat the scorpion for 500 more xp. The scorpion will attack you, but just run away once and end combat and you won't have to kill it. Your party members will, though, if you don't park them somewhere else.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The first time you pass the Agility test the Professor will give you a packet of Mentats. Actually he carries a ton.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you don't kill the scorpion you might want to steal the Spectacles off it. You can even steal its tail! If you want to hear it talk, get caught stealing from it.</p></aside><p>You can enter the mine to the north, where several super mutants are standing about. To the right inside the entrance there's a heap of rocks. Place the movement cursor just inside the wall and you'll notice you can go there. You get 1000 xp for discovering this secret area. On the floor is a guy who will get up automatically when you move next to him. Ask him who he is for another 500 xp; if you choose the other line, or if you're stupid, he runs away instead. Get the Uranium Ore from the footlocker. There's another hidden cave near the top right of the map, but it's empty.</p><aside class="green"><p>There's an infinite experience bug here... if Stodgers is prevented from leaving the map, you can save and reload, and you'll be able to talk to him again with the same outcome. Saving will make him stop if he's running, as will entering combat mode. Placing an NPC in the narrow passage will ensure that Stodgers can't get anywhere at all, so that you can repeat this as many times as you like. Telling NPCs to wait means they won't take damage from the gas, but also that they won't level up with you if you take advantage of the bug.</p></aside><p>Next bring the ore to the white ghoul in the refinery south of the caravan office. You'll have to fork out $1000 but you earn 500 xp. After the ghoul's done (takes a day) he'll offer to buy the ore back for $1500. You can either keep the ore (no use, Harold and Festus in Gecko won't even look at it), let him have it for $1500 and 300 xp, or let him have it for $1000, 1250 xp and some karma. I'd choose the latter.</p><aside class="green"><p>There's an infinite money bug here... if you take the extra $500, you can talk to the ghoul over and over again, choosing the same line and gaining $1500 each time. Once you're satisfied, either keep the ore or give it to him (though you can't get any more xp). Real <em>Fallout 2</em> players don't take advantage of poor stupid ghouls in this way.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Some random encounter merchants in the Broken Hills area carry Uranium Ore, so it's possible to do the refining bit without finding Chuck Stodgers in the mine.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="broken-hills--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#broken-hills--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-bh1"> <span>Fix the mine's air purifier.</span></summary><p>Go to Zaius in the building next to the mine entrance, agree to go get the spare parts and fix the purifier. If you ask for money you can get anything from $500 to $1000 depending on your bartering skills (you need to leave and re-enter dialogue at least once to get the last increment, which requires well over Barter 100%); you get half of it right away. Next you'll have to go to New Reno (which appears on your map) and get the Mine Parts from Renesco, which is very straightforward (except that you may have to deal with <a href="#car">Car</a> thieves, see the New Reno section, <a href="#quest-bh2">Find the missing people for Marcus</a>).

As you run, you and all organic, non-canine party members plus the <a href="#npcs--robodog">Robodog</a> will occasionally take 10-15 damage, but unless you're all wimps it shouldn't be a problem, and it stops once you use the parts on the purifier (1500 xp).

Several other kinds of protection have been said to do the trick, including having the Dermal Impact Armor, carrying or using the Oxygen Tank, running through the mine in combat mode, and having the Toughness perk. These do not work; staying in combat mode in fact means you'll take more damage. After you read a number of <em>Fallout 2</em> walkthroughs you get used to the idea that sometimes you'll be fed information which simply isn't true, speculation that at one point or another got written down as fact.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-bh2"> <span>Find the missing people for Marcus.</span></summary><p>Talk to <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> and ask him what's new.

Go down, beat up the ants (or pick them off from a distance, because your NPCs will happily fire bursts of valuable ammo at the ants if they get the chance), and walk into the room with the mutilated bodies. You get 500 xp for this. (The bodies won't show up until you've actually got the quest.) If you examine the bodies you notice they've been shot, but it makes no difference if you do or not.

You need ST 8 just to take him on, and must be level 6 or higher. There's a random element, so save before trying. If you lose, you'll find yourself the not-so-proud owner of a Ball Gag.

Like most of these towns, it's very loosely connected to the storyline (what <em>is</em> the storyline?); basically your actions here determine whether it's Vault City, New Reno or NCR that gets to benefit from the mining prospects.</p><p>Sheriff Marion has hurt his leg and needs a deputy. You need to be level 10 before he'll deem you worthy of the job. The first task he sets you means evicting a poor old widow. She's in the building to the south, next to the well. If this is your kind of work, tell her to scram, then collect the 1000 xp and $100 from the sheriff. Since Mayor Ascorti will be pleased with your performance, you can go talk to him and get a Beer each time. If you're good, instead give widow Rooney the $120 she needs and you get 1500 xp (you always get more xp being good!) plus the aforementioned cash reward, but no Beer. Although you can pay Rooney's debt directly to the mayor, don't do this as you won't get any xp. Proceed to <a href="#quest-redding4">Break up the bar brawl</a> to see what the sheriff has in mind for you next, and remember to take everything in his house.</p><aside class="green"><p>There's a bug here which actually goes for his next two quests as well (number 2 and 4 in the quest list): as long as you don't agree to take the next quest, Marion will give you whatever monetary reward you had coming every time you talk to him.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The sheriff gives you a badge, but it doesn't make any difference whether you bring it along or not. As far as the game is concerned you can dip it in chocolate and eat it the first thing you do. Also, if you're a Ranger when you come here, Marion will recognize you for such a one. (He doesn't if you talk to him after you do his quests.) This doesn't make any difference to anything, either.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>This isn't very interesting, but you can kill Rooney, then use Sneak to talk to the sheriff (who will have turned hostile along with the rest of the town). He'll complain, but he'll give you your reward and tell you to get on with the next quest. Also you can go to Ascorti and get a funny dialogue out of it. Then load your previous save game, because sooner or later you'll have to fight everyone.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>It seems reasonable to assume that it's an oversight that this does not have a quest entry in the Pip-Boy... as well as the business with Mayor Ascorti and the mine.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Jon Lynch: "In Redding, you can use the Doctor skill to heal the sheriff's broken leg, although he won't realize you did this and will still whine about it. Note that this will not work on the cook in Navarro."</p></aside><p>Madam Modjeska south of the saloon will talk to you about politics. There's a guy standing about with a rifle who'll fill you in on strange goings-on and introduce you to the notion of wanamingos (<em>not</em> "wannamingos" as everyone (including <em>Chris Avellone</em>) seems to be spelling it). You may also notice a brat named Melchior Jr. who talks about his dad, a stage magician. You'll be running into Melchior Sr. later on, but it's nothing important.</p><p>Mayor Ascorti is the owner of the Ascorti's Ace casino and city hall. He'll offer to sell you the deed to the Great Wanamingo Mine for $1000, and once you clear it of wanamingos he'll buy it back for $2500. Plus you get 1000 xp for this. The cashier in the casino has a few thousand dollars to barter (replenishes every two weeks), and you can gamble as well providing your Gambling skill is at least 25%.</p><aside class="green"><p>You can actually kill all the wanamingos before buying the deed, and once you do Ascorti will immediately know the mine is cleared so you can sell it back.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It takes about Gambling 80% to break even at the slot machines, but if you win too much the machine will stop functioning for one day. To break even at the craps table you need about Gambling 110%. With 120% you'll win slowly but steadily; just weigh down the 5 key for a while. Any more than that and you can win tens of thousands of bucks in a short time, though it beats me why anyone would want to spend skill points on Gambling before the point where they'd get almost infinite cash from looting guns anyway. As pointed out by Misha, the skill check is easier at lower bets and you can win at Gambling 100% if you press down 1 instead, although it will take longer. Note that to use a slot machine you must stand to one side of it; the game doesn't seem to care that the person blocking the machine is you. In v1.0 you didn't get any money from winning.</p></aside><p>In the Malamute saloon there's a female prostitute. If you're male you can sleep with her for $60, and then she'll tell you a sad story about how her boyfriend broke his leg and all and ask for $200 so she can begin a new life. It's a waste of money and she won't (she'll ask for another $150 each time you talk to her after that). You can also rent a room here, which works the same as in Klamath.</p><aside class="green"><p>Lou who owns the saloon won't talk to you if you've some non-human NPCs in your party (<a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>, <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>, <a href="#npcs--robodog">Robodog</a>, <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a> or the <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a> (best brain only)), so you'll have to drop them off if you want to talk to her (which is usually only when you're doing <a href="#quest-redding2">Find out who cut the whore</a>).</p></aside><p>After listening to Painless Doc Johnson and his assistant talk, ask him about the Jet problem in Redding. You can also buy some stuff from him (but he doesn't restock), or pay for healing (costs $50 (one person) or $100 (two or more) for HP, same NPCs as Dr Troy in Vault City, radiation and poison costs another $100). If you give him a dose of Jet Antidote you get 2500 xp. You can charge him $2000 for it, and it doesn't even lower your karma (although you do get 25 karma if you give it to him for free).

The dates and pay are exactly the same when going in the other direction, except that odd months become even and vice versa. Here's a rough description of how caravans work:</p><ul><li>During each trip you'll face from zero to four encounters. The caravan leader will tell you if it's OK to move on ("Let's move out"). If it's a hostile encounter, you'll need to kill the bad guys (even if they don't initiate combat themselves).</li><li>If you run off the map before the all-clear is given, this counts as abandoning the caravan and will put you on the world map. The caravan leader will effectively be dead, so you won't get any pay or more caravan jobs from him.</li><li>You won't get to bring your <a href="#car">Car</a>, and illogically the caravan path does not light up on the world map, although the specific squares where you have encounters do.</li><li>If the caravan leader dies, he'll still be around invisibly to give the all-clear signal.</li><li>If you steal from or attack caravan drivers or guards, the others won't care. Killing Stanwell, Wade or Savinelli turns Redding hostile, though.</li><li>Sometimes you may have to run off an encounter map twice to make any progress.</li><li>Beware the generally buggy behaviour of caravans. Things that can happen include the caravan "dissolving" on the world map although there was no obvious threat, and caravan leaders not being present on arrival or refusing to talk to you.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>For the Redding caravans, if the caravan leader dies along the way but you still make it to your destination, a clerk should turn up (sometimes doesn't) and pay you a reduced wage or nothing at all. You can talk to him over and over again and get $50, $100 or $150 each time (he will only state the correct amount if it's $150). In any case there won't be any more caravans on that route.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you run into New Reno mobsters, you must kill them to proceed with the caravan even though they count as good critters and aren't hostile. If you encounter a Den caravan, the slaves do not raise the "hostiles on map" counter when created, but decrease it when killed. Thus if you kill all of them (and it's hard to stop your fellow guards from doing so) the hostiles counter will actually drop below zero, which leads your caravan master not to realize that the encounter is over.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Some caravan encounters involve better weaponry than the corresponding world map encounters, notably claim jumpers, homesteaders and prospectors around Redding.</p></aside><p>It's a bit of fun to watch the mole rat fights between 12.00 and 17.00. You can bet on them and win about 50% of the time. If you have an IN below 4 the manager just takes some of your money. No one cares if you kill the caged rats for the xp, but this can cause the fights to bug out.</p><p>Don't even think about looting the graves, since they're all empty. South of the cemetery there's a morbid kind of restaurant which seems to serve no useful function (except for hinting that something's going on underground). If you ask Josh about valuables you get a free Beer. He doesn't like weird party members either.</p><p>Now for a description of the Redding underground areas. On the downtown map there are three entrances: the well south of Sheriff Marion's, a manhole in the Malamute saloon, and a manhole in the back of the casino. There are a few containers and two wanamingos down here (don't miss the skeleton). Go north and you find a cave with ladders up to the well and opened grave in the mining camp. Rats abound, and two more wanamingos can be found. Go west and you reach a system of caves infested with wanamingos. Next go down a ladder to the main level of the mine where the most wanamingos are. Once you kill them all, you get a message that you've cleared the mine, accompanied by 3500 xp. The elevator to the west will take you up to the derelict Wanamingo Mine building. You can of course enter the place from this direction as well, but it may be a little more difficult.</p><aside class="green"><p>You should just about be able to take the wanamingos on if you've done everything described previously in this walkthrough and are at level 12 or so (with NPCs). Combat Shotguns rule, while a 10mm SMG does next to no damage to these armored critters. If you're the sniping kind, shots to the eyes are effective at long range, while if they get too close (and it's hard to stop them) you should try to cripple their legs. Crippling any limb will make them flee, but going for the legs makes them worse at it.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Actually you have to kill all wanamingos but one to clear the mine. You don't have to kill the eggs, but why let them live so they can come after you?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There's a rather well hidden Metal Armor Mark II lying in the room northeast of the elevator. Look to the right of the broken crate.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you enter the casino from the manhole, and then kill the guard behind the metal door quietly (using Super Stimpaks or planting explosives), you can loot the fridge and footlocker for several thousand Mine Scrips as well as the contents of the store, but not much more. Beware that if you let the guard see you and then leave, he'll shoot on sight when you return, so be prepared to off him as soon as you open the metal door.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="redding--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#redding--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-redding1"> <span>Kill Frog Morton.</span></summary><p>Your fourth and final mission for Sheriff Marion. Morton's gang resides in the old Wanamingo Mine building to the west and only appears when you get this quest, along with some mines dotted among the ruins (15 in all). You might want to go to this map before that so you can pick off the rats at your leisure. Morton's gang will be heavily armed, but at level 10-12 you should be able to gun them down as they come pouring out of the building. There are also three men in the buildings to the south. You gain 3000 xp when the whole gang is dead, and $1000 from the sheriff. Marion then informs you that Froggy has three brothers who'll be coming after you, namely Snake, Toad and Newt Morton. You'll run across these on the world map, one by one, but, well, that's just more weapons and ammo for you.</p><aside class="green"><p>If a bandit spots a mine it is automatically disarmed, but the rats will set them off if they're still around.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Frog's H&K G11 is a neat weapon at this point, problem is you probably won't have much ammo for it yet. Buster in NCR can sell you some, and there's a heap in the Toxic Caves. If you can kill Frog before he can attack, you'll have 100 rounds to use on the wanamingos.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>You can get to the area behind the large building if you go to the top of the screen, just left of the exit grid, then click on the ground on the other side of the fence (if you don't position your character correctly you might step on the exit grid trying to get there). There is nothing to see or pick up back there, however.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-redding2"> <span>Find out who cut the whore.</span></summary><p>Marion's third task (for some reason they're numbered in reverse chronological order). Go to the Malamute saloon and talk to Lou for a clue: a Morningstar Mine scrip (though you don't actually get one). Well then, go to the Morningstar Mine and ask around. The offender, Obidiah Hakeswill, will confess to the crime as soon as you adress him, whereupon you can kill him ($500 from Marion but no quest xp), let him go (no xp and no money from the sheriff) or take him into custody (1250 xp and $500).</p><aside class="green"><p>There are two possible bugs here. Firstly, killing Hakeswill before you get the quest and returning to the sheriff will earn you the reward of $500 and an offer to do <a href="#quest-redding1">Kill Frog Morton</a>, meaning you can no longer get the first two jobs if you didn't already. Secondly, as found by Szappy, if you let Hakeswill go and then insult the sheriff, dialogue may revert to before you even got the first job, though this will have no actual effect.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-redding3"> <span>Find the excavator chip.</span></summary><p>There are two chips to be found in the mine, both on the lowest level with the toughest wanamingos. You get one from the excavator, and there's another one found on the ground to the northeast, next to one of the manufacturing doohikeys. Sadly you can only sell one of them, so head over to either Dan McGrew or Marge LeBarge and sell it for $1000 and 2500 xp. Which of them you choose has no effect other than it may decide which ending you get for Redding.</p><aside class="red"><p>Basically, Dan supports New Reno and Marge supports NCR. It seems the designers couldn't quite make up their minds, though, as Jimmy Hoffa has them mixed up, and if you sell the chip to McGrew then LeBarge will go on about "those prissy NCR bastards" McGrew is in league with...</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-redding4"> <span>Break up the bar brawl.</span></summary><p>This is Sheriff Marion's second task for you. Head into the bar and talk to the two miners who are facing off. If you ask them to back down, they will, but nothing happens. Therefore you have to threaten them with some of the old ultra-violence and put one of them or both in jail (but don't provoke them into a fight, the whole town will turn against you). Except for what kind of comments the Sheriff and McGrew will give you, it doesn't matter one bit what you do. Your reward is 1500 xp and $300 from the sheriff.</p><aside class="green"><p>You cannot complete this quest by talking both parties out of a fight, you have to put someone in jail. The patch notes state that getting Bette to back down should set the quest to complete, but in actuality it only sets the quest variable to the same value that it would get if you ran out the door! (Getting Caminetto to back down does nothing in either version.) So essentially, all this "bugfix" did was make a lot of people think there's a way of finishing the quest properly without throwing anyone in jail, although there never was. I always arrest them both for fairness' sake. In case you really must know, Kokoweef is the "good" mine, but let's not judge a bar brawler by her employer, shall we?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you kill the miners and use Sneak to talk to the sheriff, you'll be rewarded with $150, and of course he'll want to kill you, too.</p></aside></details><details class="rp"><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-redding5"> <span>Cure Fannie of her jet addiction (not available to female characters).</span></summary><p>Fannie Mae is a 'hostess' working in the Malamute Saloon.

Pink deathclaw, three o'clock!</p><footer><cite>New Reno junkie</cite></footer></blockquote><p>New Reno can be a little daunting, since it's a big place with lots of things to do, and a lot of things to think about, such as how to make sure one doesn't piss off any of the local crime bosses, and where did that damn <a href="#car">Car</a> go? (Don't worry, it's around - see <a href="#quest-reno2">Recover your stolen car</a>.) This city is run by the families Mordino, Salvatore, Bishop and Wright, of which only the last ones are not scum of the earth. Usually if you turn down a job, speak to a boss disrespectfully, ask too many questions or return to them before finishing a job, they may refuse to give you any more jobs or, more likely, attack. Toe the line if you want to keep your options open.</p><p>For each boss there is a chain of quests, upon the completion of which you become a Made Man of that family. This means you get a popularity boost among the citizenry, free sex at the Cat's Paw, special services at the New Reno Arms (but seemingly no discount on Eldridge's normal stock, nor Renesco's), and a shot in the head if you ever go to visit any of the other families. If you don't fancy this you can still complete the final quest for each family as long as you don't return to the boss for your reward, which is when you become a Made Man. But, since you lose the Made Man reputation if you turn against your own family, it's possible to complete and collect the rewards for all quests in New Reno. There are a few things you have to think about, though. Don't become a Made Man of the Salvatores until you've got the quest from Mordino to kill Salvatore. And if you play a "good" game, become Made Man of the Wrights last so you can let them live. (Remember you can still go to the Sierra Army Depot for equipment to help you take out the other families, as long as you don't return to Wright and claim your reward.)</p><aside class="green"><p>For each family boss, there's a way to assassinate them (noted below) without getting blamed for it. Note that killing a boss "silently" (Super Stimpaks etc.; see the NCR section) or in these special ways will not remove your Made Man status, but attacking anyone in the family openly will.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have a family quest active when you turn that family hostile, the quest will be crossed out (set to failed) in your quest list. If you manage to talk to your employer without him attacking you may get some unexpected dialogue in this case (this happens, for instance, if you kill the guard who goes to check Bishop's safe and then talk to Bishop).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's possible to be listed on your character sheet as Made Man for all four families at the same time, as outlined by <em>Sébastien Caisse</em>: "Once you've become a Made Man for a specific family, this family won't attack you any more. First you need to do all the possible quests for them, and not collect the final reward, and not assassinate Salvatore (until you're a Made Man for him). The trick is basically to sneak past everyone and collect your final reward by talking to the bosses before they engage in combat." Ryan P. Fialcowitz and Joshua Jansen then looked into the particulars and found there is another constraint: you must become Made Man for Bishop first, since Bishop's dialogue will change for the worse if you're already with some other family. This means that if you want all four you must end up allied with either the Wrights or the Mordinos. You will need to use a combination of Sneaking and running in combat mode to reach all bosses - saving a lot is recommended. Getting through the door to Salvatore is one of the tricky parts, but John Gaw points out: "If you talk to Mason while on good grounds, you can go into attack mode later and open the door with no problem whatsoever." Two more things should be noted. Firstly, despite what your character sheet says you will only be Made Man for one family at a time as far as the game is concerned, so there's no real reward for doing all this. Secondly, attacking the family you joined last will remove <em>all</em> Made Man labels from your list of reputations, but attacking any other family, including one you joined earlier, has no effect on them.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can pretty much forget about most things in New Reno, since you can't join any family (or do any other quest). Also you can't get Golgotha, Stables or the Sierra Army Depot on your world map.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you're a Prizefighter, Porn Star, Slaver or Made Man and use Sneak in New Reno you may receive comments from its inhabitants that could lead you to believe it's harder to sneak in these cases; however, they don't change the actual probability of being detected.</p></aside><p>Arriving on Virgin Street, one of the first people you meet is Jules. He'll try to sell you drugs (restocks some Jet and Stimpaks every 12-24 hours), but can also sell information for money, between $25 and $100 for each family depending on your Barter skill. You can get this information cheaper from Father Tully, but you should at least get Jules to mention the names of the families. He'll also give you a recommendation to the New Reno Arms (which does nothing) and the Cat's Paw (which gives you a discount). Make sure you follow the Jet conversation thread, and the Stables and Golgotha will turn up on the world map. If you ask him about Vault 13 he puts Vault City on your world map (this goes for Mrs Bishop, Father Tully and Mrs Wright as well), and talking about Redding puts that on the map.</p><aside class="rp"><p>The 'Barking man' is a new character that you can help. If you find and talk to him (located in the very back of the building that is northwest of Jules), you can determine that he has a case of epilepsy if you have 75 science. See the EPA section on how to help him.</p></aside><aside class="rp"><p>'Three-Card Monte' is also a new character that can be found near the big sign between Virgin street and Second street. You can gamble with him (but he cheats). He can also give you information about the Richard Wright OD, Pretty Boy Lloyd, Your missing <a href="#car">Car</a>, Eldridge, and the location of Golgotha. He will sell you information, 100-200$ for info on Eldridge and $250-$1000 for quest related stuff (harder speech check the lower you offer him). There is another way though. He cheats at cards so why not cheat him back? Steal his deck of cards and replace it with a marked deck, or simply buy his deck and sell him your marked one (100xp).</p><p>Marked cards can be found on a shelf upstairs at the Desperado or dug up from one of the northern graves at Golgotha. After you've won 11 times (and are $200 richer), he won't be able to pay you his debt, so you can get information for free (only once).</p><p>To ask him for quest info, you have to have the quests active. Also, you can only get the info for free at the time you have beaten him, you can't come back later and ask for it.</p><p>If you buy info from Monte, that money gets added to his gambling pot. So you can just buy all the info and then win your money back.</p><p>Note: Once you have cleaned him out, he will not gamble with you anymore, even if you buy info from him.</p></aside><p>Over at the Cat's Paw you can get laid, which on occasion gives you a temporary +1 stat boost for one hour:</p><dl><dt>Oral attention</dt><dd>Strength.</dd><dt>Basic, dirty sex (CH&lt;6)</dt><dd>Agility.</dd><dt>Full body workout (CH&gt;5)</dt><dd>Agility.</dd><dt>Just talk</dt><dd>Intelligence.</dd><dt>"Special... dramatic... request" (IN&gt;5)</dt><dd>Strength.</dd></dl><aside class="rp"><p>Going on a date with Miss Kitty now gives +1 AG if you successfully asked her out before the end of the game.

The bartender in the Desperado will sell you beer and such stuff. You can gamble here, but the croupiers all carry Loaded Dice so you can figure your chances. See Redding for a note on gambling.</p><aside class="green"><p>New Reno bartenders will charge you more if you're a Prizefighter, if you're a Made Man for their family, or if you finished the game, and you ask them to trade in dialogue. Drug dealers charge you more if you've finished the game, if you're a Prizefighter, if you're a Porn Star, or if you're a Made Man for any family, and you ask them to trade in dialogue. Drug dealers also correctly charge you more if you carry a lot of money (which in their eyes amounts to $200 or more), but you can still circumvent this by pressing the barter button.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>If you plant more than one pair of dice on a casino dealer before talking to her, the dice will all disappear, and a dealer with no dice will tell you that her table has been closed down due to someone tampering with the dice.

If you talk to him with a Knife, Combat Knife, Ripper or Throwing Knife in your hand, he'll offer to teach you +5% Melee Weapons for $200 (you can turn him down and return later). If you're female and have at least CH 6 or are a Porn Star you'll have to have sex with him instead. Yech. However, if you do this and have a good sex rating, you'll gain +10% to Melee Weapons. He can also put Redding on your world map, and the Stables if you talk to him after becoming a Made Man of the Mordinos.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you got the correct clue from the Magic 8-Ball, use the toilet which brings up the hand icon to recover 1 Frag Grenade, 1 Plasma Grenade and 1 Pulse Grenade.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You may notice that Big Jesus' health isn't what it should be.

Unlike Boss Salvatore you don't get these extra xp if you kill Big Jesus in combat, so once you turn on the Mordino family this should be your first move.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you're a Slaver you can sell some of your pardners to Big Jesus (<a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> for $100, <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> for $100, <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> for $250, <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> for $200, <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a> (best brain only) for $500, <a href="#npcs--robodog">Robodog</a> for $500). To get this option you must either speak to Little Jesus about the subject, or ask Big Jesus about his health (Doctor 51% or Science 76%) or about Richard Wright (if you have that quest) and then say you have more questions. You can haggle once for each NPC and double the price with a successful Barter check, but any more than that and he kicks you out. Like Barkus, Big Jesus bids on one slave at a time starting with <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a>/<a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a>. The slaves you sell don't disappear, though, they just leave your party and remain standing where they were. If you talk to them their dialogue will be as if you never recruited them in the first place, and things can get rather screwed up (e.g., if you try to sleep with <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> again the game gets stuck in a permanent blackout).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> with you when you go to Big Jesus, he'll attack.

Listen to his story about his scar and if you have CH 6 he gives you 2 Jet for free. He can put the Stables on your map if you ask him where he gets his Jet. There are two more chem dealers further up the street. The three musicians don't do much.</p><aside class="green"><p>Tom Hibbs found a bug: "An infinite number of Jet vials can be obtained from Jagged Jimmy J. After the first 2 that he gives you, he continues to give 1 free Jet each time you thank him and ask what else is in stock (this doesn't work if you just click the barter button). By seeing JJJ's wares and then clicking done without bartering anything, your Jet supply can climb infinitely." This only works the first time you get to this node.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: If you are a Made Man, Porn Star or a Prizefighter or if you finished the game, talk to Jimmy, and when he recognizes you choose the "mortal coil" line. This will paralyze his brain so that you can take all his stuff, which is not a lot.</p></aside><p>If you go into the Jungle Gym and talk to Stuart Little you can box. You'll meet four increasingly difficult opponents: Joqq ($50, 500 xp), Pete McKneely ($50, 750 xp), Evan Holyfeld ($400, 1000 xp), and the Masticator ($1000, 2500 xp). This is assuming you get 50% of the winnings; with Speech 76% <em>and</em> Barter 76% you can get 75% instead. You also get kill xp for those boxers you manage to beat to death; this should happen some of the time and counts as a knockout. Other ways of winning include "normal" knockout (if you score a critical hit that knocks your opponent unconscious or if he himself manages a critical failure), technical knockout (if you make him flee), and points (if you somehow manage to make a fight last 12 full rounds and win the majority of them by landing more punches than your opponent). If you win four matches you get the Prizefighter reputation which lets you empty the gym lockers, makes you popular in New Reno and gives you a +5% bonus to your Unarmed skill.</p><p>Should you lose a fight, you must ask Little for a rematch immediately or you won't get another chance. You'll then go up against another boxer (your royalties will drop to 25%, but the xp is the same). You can only convince Little to give you one more chance (unless you exploit a bug, see note below), which means you can fight five matches in all, and there's a tempting reason to do that (see another note below).</p><aside class="green"><p>Boxing isn't very difficult, at least not on normal difficulty. In fact, without having spent a single point on Unarmed (it was at 65%) and using normal gloves, I was able to easily kill the first two boxers in the first round, then win by knockout against the two tough ones. If you find you don't inflict any damage, go for aimed blows to the head. Just remember to ask Little for some time to rest so you can save before each match, and heal up if necessary (during matches you regain a number of HP equal to your EN at the end of every full round).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have the Plated Boxing Gloves in your inventory when you talk to Stuart Little, you'll be fighting with them in the ring. You always get a normal pair of Boxing Gloves in your inventory just before the first match, but if you enter subsequent fights without any gloves at all in your inventory, you end up in the ring with no gloves!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>At the start of every match, if you have either kind of gloves, you gain a permanent +3 bonus to your Damage Threshold for normal damage (to a maximum of 100), -1 to your DT for plasma and explosive damage, and a bonus to Damage Resistance for each listed damage type except fire (to a maximum of 90%). If you only have normal gloves you get +1% DR for all four types, but if you have plated ones you get +2% for normal damage, +5% for laser damage and +1% for the others. (There's also a -1% penalty to your unlisted EMP resistance, but this doesn't matter in the least; your electricity resistance is unaffected.) You get to keep these bonuses even if you lose that match. Therefore, in the fourth match, you can kick your opponent, ask Little for another shot, then win the final match (the Masticator's replacement is significantly weaker and doesn't bite) and you'll have got a fifth toughness bonus for only $500. Even factoring in the DT penalties that's better than any combat implant! Silencer muses: "Perhaps the resistance boosts were just supposed to be temporary and not permanent - that'd explain why plated gloves give you better ones, since you can block and shield your sorry face better with them." That only covers one damage type, though.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Before you win the Prizefighter title it's actually possible to get infinite rematches, although this is the result of two bugs. If you've won the game, Little's dialogue will always go as if you're talking to him for the first time, meaning you can ask about boxing, negotiate a deal and get your "first" match (though the game keeps track of how many opponents you have defeated). If you have still not won the game, you have to leave dialogue after losing a fight, talk to him again, ask for a rematch and <em>fail</em> a Speech check (which is impossible if you're at 100% or above). He will then let you box again. Note that the only reason for doing this is to up your resistances, which is a bit cheesy. In fact, knowing that you can raise them arbitrarily puts a damper on my desire to get that fifth bonus, since I usually have no problem taking advantage of limited glitches but have no interest in the unlimited ones.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>This isn't kickboxing. If you switch to kicking or take off your gloves and then land a blow, you'll be disqualified. (How do you take off boxing gloves in the ring, anyway? With your teeth?)</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you lose by knockout there may be a bug that makes you lose the rematch before you even get to start fighting. This is because when combat ends directly after you score a critical failure that makes you lose your next turn, the game remembers that you have a lost turn coming up, and if that happens to be at the start of the next fight you lose again. Simply entering combat mode once in between the fights to get rid of this "debt" should take care of the matter (assuming you wouldn't rather reload after such an unfortunate occurrence).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have about 115 HP or fewer and the Masticator hits you, you may get the message "In the heat of the fight, the Masticator tears your ear off." If you look in your inventory you'll now have a Player's Ear item... and your CH drops by 1 permanently. This is not so good, so you should probably do what the game says and reload. If you keep fighting, though, and have Unarmed at about 160% or higher, you may end up with a Masticator's Ear as well - vengeance is sweet! No use for it, I'm afraid, but it's worth $750. In the unpatched version losing your ear could give you a <em>bonus</em> to your CH, because the command to change the stat was being used incorrectly. This bonus would be equal to your current CH minus one, except if this would take your new CH above 10 in which case nothing would happen.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>At the beginning of each round starting with the second, after the ring girl appears and the other boxer runs towards you, there's a small window where you can press A to enter combat mode. You can use this extra round to attack your opponent, or you can use it to kill the ring girl. The latter changes nothing except that the ring girl will be lying in a pool of blood instead of walking around and saying "Round 3!" or whatever. Well, I thought it was hilarious anyway. If you manage to kill your opponent in this combat round, you will be stuck forever inside the ring after the announcer makes a brief appearance. You can get an odd item - the Special Boxer Weapon, a useless sort of club - by killing the ring girl, then knocking a boxer unconscious on the same hex and looting his body before the combat round ends. There's another opportunity to enter combat mode right at the end of a match where you can kill the announcer (if you don't manage this in one hit you'll have to keep pressing A), but again this will leave you trapped.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Stupid characters can box providing they are male and have ST 6.

There's a bearded guy with a Hunting Rifle standing around sometimes and you can ask the bartender who he is, but he doesn't do anything except that when you fight Bishop's men he'll fight with them (there is a dialogue file for him but it's not used in the game). In the basement you find the Masticator and a boxing ring which is never used (legend has it that the final boxing fight was supposed to take place in here before an audience), but pick up the Plated Boxing Gloves for use in the boxing matches.</p><aside class="rp"><p>At the Shark Club, female characters can now dance, and male characters can now be a comedian, and get paid for it: $300 every time and 150xp the first time for Male comedian.

You can give him the money for +10 karma, or convince him to accept half of the money for +5 karma, and he will be happy. If you choose to talk about it, you'll have to pass two fairly easy speech checks before having to pay him some money back, but better to skip those and offer him the money right away.

Female characters can scare her pretty good, but it doesn't do anything. If you are wearing power armor you'll have to remove it before talking to her.</p><p>Characters of either sex can sleep with Mrs Bishop any number of times if they meet with her approval, which requires either ST 6 or CH 6; she'll ask you to join her for a drink as you leave conversation. If you refuse you must find a dialogue option to tell her you'll be back, or else she won't talk to you again. If you follow her upstairs and <em>then</em> refuse to sleep with her, you'll need to use Speech to tell her you have an appointment with Jules or she'll call for the guards. After you've slept with her and left conversation, "talk" to her until she mumbles the combination to her safe, then Lockpick it to get the stuff inside. If you have IN 9, you can get an additional goody here. First you must ask her downstairs if she knows anything about the G.E.C.K. or Vault 13 (which means you must not have found them yet) and get her to mention Vault City. In the conversation after you sleep with her you'll then be able to ask her if she is from Vault City, and eventually she lets you have the Pip Boy Lingual Enhancer hidden in her safe (250 xp) which can be used for a permanent +10% to Speech and 500 xp.

If you have a Condom in your inventory it'll be used up, though, and will prevent this.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There's a bug here that could startle you a bit. When going with Ms or Mrs Bishop, if you save and reload the game while on the top floor, your entire party will have disappeared when you return to the first floor. To fix this, sleep with either of them again (they'll return downstairs when the game loads the map anew, you can go down to the basement of the casino to make this happen) and your NPCs should be back. Or you could just drop everyone from your party before talking to your lady of choice. You may also experience <a href="#car">Car</a> trunk deprival symptoms in this situation, but it should return once you drive to another map. Interestingly, NPCs can earn levels while invisible. Fighting <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> in NCR will restore to visibility any party members that normally disappear during that fight (they'll appear when you move to another map).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Fall_ark found out how to exploit the invisibility bug to recruit an army. With CH 10, fill your party up to the 5-NPC limit, then make it disappear. Other NPCs will now think your party is empty, so you can get them to join you until you are again at the normal limit. When this is done, turn your "old" party visible again, and finally mop up those NPCs who will join you regardless of the current party count: <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a>/<a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a>, <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a>, <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> (initially), pariah dog (optionally). You could get evil <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a> for free as well, but you don't have to, since the good one can be fit within your "regular" party of ten. Minor points to consider: 1) Once your army is assembled you probably won't want to tell anyone to leave since getting them back will be a lot of work, and it may not even be possible to get back up to full strength by repeating the procedure. 2) Invisible party members may cause minor problems in places like Vault City and NCR, though this should be easy to plan around. Being Captain in Vault City helps greatly if you plan to go back there later, but avoid Lynette. 3) Since you're cheating anyway, you might as well use the save/load chem trick to get your CH high enough using Mentats, if needed. 4) If you don't want to fight Navarro when you come for <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> with your huge party, you can prep it in advance and assassinate Schreber and "Snookie" to establish a clear path from the vent.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can go with both Ms and Mrs Bishop if you meet their respective requirements, and you can open Mrs Bishop's safe this way, but you don't get to talk to her after sex.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's not recommended to steal from Mrs Bishop; if you fail, a guard is supposed to come running, but this causes my game to freeze. It seems to work for Ms Bishop, though: she runs away, and a guard comes running to attack.</p></aside><p>You can also crack Angela Bishop's safe (if you followed her to her room, it will already be open). Mr Bishop's safe is trapped, so use Traps on it before picking the lock. If your safe-cracking skills aren't what they should be, you can place some Dynamite in front of the safe to set off the trap and unlock the safe. If you set off the trap in whichever way, you should head for the far corner of the screen as a Bishop guard will run into the room to investigate briefly (fighting him will turn the others hostile, although it may not be apparent right away). The safe contains a Raiders Map which puts the raider base on your world map if you didn't find it already, and a Bishop's Holodisk which you should take to Lynette in Vault City. If you leave the map and return, the safe will be re-trapped and locked.</p><aside class="green"><p>You can also open the other two safes with Dynamite, and this will cause the guard to come running as well. If you try to pick a safe and fail the Lockpick check, then there's a small chance proportional to your LK that you can open the safe by spinning the dial randomly. This works for Mrs Bishop's safe as well even though it cannot be cracked normally.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you wiped out the raiders, then if you ever turn down a job offered by Bishop he'll know you did it and say you have to take the job (without pay) to even the score. (He may say you had Skynet with you even if you never met the freaking bot yet - he really means <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, but the variables are mixed up.) If you didn't kill the raiders, but slept with Ms and/or Mrs Bishop, he'll use that as leverage instead with the same results. If you still won't do it, he'll attack. Getting into these conversations at all is bad, as you can see from the ending of <a href="#quest-reno10">Murder Carlson in NCR</a>. If you do become Made Man and then talk to Bishop again he'll start up these dialogues (assuming you did anything to offend him) and you'll have no choice but to fight him.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The way to assassinate Mr Bishop isn't very obvious. First you have to sleep with Mrs Bishop. In bed, ask her about her husband, ask her if they love each other, then about Mr Bishop's "other pursuits". You'll now get the option to ask if she wants you to kill him. With Traps 76% you can suggest an "accident", and Mrs Bishop then tells you about the trap on Mr Bishop's safe. Use Repair (again you need 76%) on the safe to change the combination. Go downstairs and wait 10 minutes with your Pip-Boy and you'll hear a boom from upstairs, which <em>may</em> kill Mr Bishop - at other times I've seen it do only 1 point of damage to him. You get no xp for this, though. If you already disarmed the trap, the game will tell you to replace it before you can change the combination. Attempting to do so will crash the game, however. The solution to this is to go to the basement (changing maps) and return, whereupon the trap will be re-armed.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's not a good idea to "teleport" to the second floor by sleeping with Ms or Mrs Bishop before you've got permission from the guards to see Mr Bishop, or he'll attack if he sees you on the way out (keep close to the wall, try to run past in combat mode, or Sneak if you have to). Later on it may not matter as much, since Mr Bishop doesn't seem to mind that much that you're sleeping with his wife as long as you're working for him, but as usual if you talk to a boss too many times before finishing a job you may find yourself looking at dialogue choices which all lead to combat. To be safe, only follow the ladies upstairs when you were going to talk to Bishop anyway.</p></aside><p>In Salvatore's Bar you can buy drinks, and there's a guy named Bill who does nothing.</p><aside class="rp"><p>'Nikki' is another new character that can be found in Salvatore's casino in the back room. She knows where Pretty Boy Lloyd is hiding. You can bribe her into telling you for 500$. This is what he owes her for her part in the scam. You get 250xp. If you threaten her, she only tells you she's heard he's staying at the Desperado, but won't say he's in the boiler room and you get no xp. There is a speech check, but I don't think it's very high.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>To kill Boss Salvatore, simply steal his Oxygen Tank. In order to make a true assassination, for which you get 2000 xp, three conditions need to be met: 1) Salvatore must not carry an Oxygen Tank, 2) <em>you</em> must carry the Poison Tank from the Desperado basement (scripting error), and 3) Salvatore must not be hostile. You can also get 500 xp if you "whack" Salvatore somewhat less subtly, or if you don't have the Poison Tank. In this case Mason will turn hostile, but you can still get away without a fight by leaving the place while waiting for Salvatore to snuff it. Note that if you steal the Oxygen Tank, wait for Salvatore's "attack" to begin and then plant the tank back onto him, he'll call for the guards.</p></aside><p>Over in the commercial district the junkies accumulate Jet during the game for some reason, I've seen them carry 15-25 apiece. Renesco the Rocketman sells stuff (restocks every 2-5 days), and he can tell you about Redding's Jet problem (puts Redding on the map), or put the NCR and Vault City on the map if you ask him about the G.E.C.K. Pissing him off with the Arroyo story or in any other way doesn't seem to have any lasting effect. Using the "teeth as a necklace"line will make his wares more expensive, but only until you leave dialogue. If you're here for the Broken Hills mine parts, tell him the password if you got it from Zaius, or you'll have to pay $100 for them ($200 if you try to haggle). The latter causes the debugging message "GIVE_RENESCO_CAPS 100" (or "200") to appear in the message window. Quaint. If you kill him the Mine Parts appear on his body if he didn't already give them to you.</p><p>Here's also where you can obtain one of the most obscure items in the entire game: the Pip Boy Medical Enhancer! You can give the Spectacles (from Broken Hills) to him and ask for a favor or a discount, but <em>don't</em> ask for a discount - it doesn't have any effect, and this way you don't get the Enhancer. Instead choose any of the other two lines, and then when you talk to Renesco you'll have the option of asking him how the glasses are. Do this 20 times and he'll become so exasperated he gives you the Enhancer, which upon consumption yields 500 xp and a permanent Doctor +10%!</p><p>Eldridge at the New Reno Arms will sell you stuff (restocks every 1-3 days), upgrade weapons, and sell you a Computer Voice Module for $3000 (you can talk it down to $2500 with a Barter check, or $1500 if you have CH 9 or make a critical Barter check) in case you didn't get one from Vault City. He'll warn you and then attack if you walk behind the fence. However, there's nothing stopping you from entering through the back door and looting his place. Don't do this at night when Eldridge is in the back, though, or the dogs will attack. Look for the staircase behind some metal shelves. Once you're in the basement, look out for Small Energy Cells on the ground as well as "hidden" containers. In here you'll find what's probably your first Electronic Lockpick, which means you can now go back to the Toxic Caves. Algernon is the guy who does the tinkering for Eldridge, and he'll do every kind of weapon upgrade for free if you just give him the item; if you use his services, make sure it's daytime before you go back up again. If you kill Algernon and then ask Eldridge if he can upgrade weapons, he says there's been an accident and they don't do it any more. 🙂</p><aside class="rp"><p>Eldridge the gun merchant will now go back and check on his dogs if they bark too much (as was originally planned). So pay attention when he starts moving and don't hang around if you don't want to get caught. Also his front door is now locked at night time.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Being a Made Man of any family will give you access to Eldridge's special stock, which includes a Bozar and a Super Sledge. Which items he has at a particular time is slightly random, just like shops in general. If you don't see what you want, try leaving and re-entering the barter window; if that doesn't work, return at a later date (2-4 days). Should you kill Eldridge this stock will appear in his corpse along with his regular wares, even if you were never a Made Man.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Eldridge's upgrade prices were supposed to be influenced by Barter, but the only effect of this is that if you have Barter at 91% or more, all upgrades will be free. Otherwise, see the Items section.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can't get any upgrades, here or anywhere else in the game. What's more, if you talk to Algernon and "shoot" him... he dies!</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>A little to the left of the broken mattress in the rightmost corner of the basement, you can see a partly obscured pot. In it you find the Easter Egg. Oh joy.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>After you've been to the Enclave, Eldridge becomes a little bugged. If you buy stuff from him he says you'll get a discount but he overcharges you horribly (this is the same reversed barter modifier bug as in Vault City and with the casino bartenders), and if asked for upgrades he always attacks (because the script points to the wrong node).</p></aside><p>If Father Tully is lying drunk in the back of the church, rest for two hours and he'll be awake and ready to answer questions about the New Reno families if you give him any kind of booze (you must have heard of a family to be able to ask about it). You should get him to tell you about the Salvatores and their laser weapons, other than that it's nothing crucial. Should you be Married, you can let Tully divorce you for a bottle of alcohol. Your spouse will run away bitterly and never be seen again, and from then on you are Separated. Watch out that they don't make away with precious items of yours (their inventory will actually disappear once the ceremony ends, since the person running away is technically a different critter).</p><aside class="green"><p>You can loot the poor box for -3 karma. Better money-for-karma ratio than in the Modoc well, anyway. If you ask Father Tully for money to buy hootch he'll rob the box for you, but you still suffer the karma drop. You can also donate at least one coin to gain 3 karma. What's more, both the gain and the loss happen only once, so you can withdraw your donation and return for more every week. In the back of the church there's a small garden with 2 Broc Flowers and 3 Xander Roots. Nice detail, easily missed.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 you can talk to Father Tully about any number of topics as long as you give him something to drink and make sure not to end the dialogue.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you return to Father Tully after finishing the game, he'll give you the Fallout 2 Hintbook which gives you 10,000 xp every time you use it and raises all your skills to 300% (possibly 299% if tagged). While on that topic, New Reno is one of the two places (Vault City being the other) where people will have new dialogue or floating text after you complete the game. Notably, there's the line about using the Mutated Toe on Horrigan.</p></aside><p>If you enter the East Side during daytime there'll be children running around outside the Wright mansion; if they're not there, wait until noon, exit and re-enter the map.

The kids will lead you into the desert to witness the secret transaction (see <a href="#quest-reno6">Help guard a secret transaction taking place in the desert</a>) if you have CH 7, have the Empathy perk, make a Speech check, or give them a handgun and get a good reaction (in fact, if you happen to carry a gun you'll have to give it to them before they'll bring you along). You get 1500 xp if you stay hidden until the transaction is completed. To leave the screen without being seen, walk straight down. If you gave the kids a gun (or even planted it on one of them), when you return to the East Side the four running kids will all have got themselves shot! You can retrieve your gun though.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you're a Slaver, or if you're a Made Man of another family, you can't talk to the kids to begin with. If you're wearing any kind of Power Armor, you have to remove it before they'll talk to you. Incidentally, there's lots of different floating dialogue from townspeople in New Reno if you're wearing Power Armor.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you already did <a href="#quest-reno6">Help guard a secret transaction taking place in the desert</a> you won't get the 1500 xp, but if you're up to it you can get more kill xp than that out of this encounter. You should only do battle if you already finished your business with the Salvatores, though, because they'll know somehow and turn hostile.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>To assassinate Boss Wright, give the kid a gun and tell him to wave it in his father's face and pull the trigger. You don't get any xp for this, though. You can still get the desert transaction by talking to the kids again. You can prevent the kids from shooting themselves or Orville if you steal the gun back before leaving the map.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Use Traps on Orville's safe, and even if it tells you that you were successful, don't stop until you get the message that you gained 100 xp (free Dynamite!). You can then pick it and take the stuff inside. If you leave the map and return, the safe will be re-trapped and locked (more free Dynamite!). In Orville's room, Ethyl's room, and the one on the bottom left, you can take plenty of stuff from the shelves without anyone complaining.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can follow the kids to the secret transaction by choosing one of the "incest" lines and then the first option each time after that.

Don't worry, it's not actually a <a href="#car">Car</a> bug (as many people have believed, with some justification). If you walk over to where the <a href="#car">Car</a> was standing you'll get the option to follow the tracks. If you ask Jules about it he'll be very evasive, but if you threaten him he'll show you where the <a href="#car">Car</a> was taken. The best option is to talk to Cody, the boy outside the Cat's Paw, and ask him to lead you to the <a href="#car">Car</a>, which earns you 500 xp. You can also ask him who stole it (he'll indicate Jules was involved), but then you have to tell Jules you'll kill him if anything happens to Cody, <em>before</em> you leave this map, or else, well, something will happen to Cody. If by any chance you let something happen to Cody you can confront Jules about it, in which case he makes a run for it.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you approach Cody in any kind of Power Armor, or if you offer him drugs or food, or if you're a Slaver or Childkiller, or if you have <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> or <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> in your party, or if your karma is -101 or lower, or if you have IN&lt;4 and tell him anything other than that your <a href="#car">Car</a> has been stolen, he'll run away. If you wait for a minute without leaving the map he'll calm down so you can try again, or else he'll never talk to you again.</p></aside><p>Anyway. Once you're at the chop shop, go into the garage and seek out T-Ray. There are a few ways to get your <a href="#car">Car</a> back:</p><ul><li>If you're a Made Man of the Bishops you can tell him Bishop sent you for the <a href="#car">Car</a>. He'll want money, and you can then offer him $1500, $900 or nothing; as long as you throw Bishop's name around he'll be too scared to object. When he mentions batteries the message window will say "Error" and you get 1002 xp. This is because the script really should have displayed line #1002 in T-Ray's dialogue file and given you 750 xp for getting free batteries (which you don't), but now it tries to print the non-existent line #750 instead...</li><li>Trick T-Ray into thinking you're a Made Man if you're not. This is bugged so that you make it if you <em>fail</em> your Speech check and your CH is 7 or <em>less</em>. You can actually talk to him again and again until you succeed (that is, fail). As regards money and xp this works exactly as above except you gain 750 additional xp.</li><li>Pay T-Ray $1000 for the <a href="#car">Car</a> ($750 or $500 with good to decent Barter).</li><li>Sleep with him if you're female with CH&gt;6 or Porn Star.</li><li>Try to drive away. The chop shop people will initiate combat after you do this twice. In case the critter who caught you is a cowardly mechanic he'll run away; you can then use the <a href="#car">Car</a> again and off you go. If it's a thug, however, you'll have to...</li><li>Kill the whole bunch.</li></ul><p>You get 750 xp for resolving the situation in any of the first five ways; if you drove off you have to return to get the xp. If you left T-Ray alive you can pay him $500 ($300 with decent Barter) for a general <a href="#car">Car</a> upgrade: increased trunk space (which is a blessing) and better engine performance. It's important that you get this upgrade right away, because once you drive the <a href="#car">Car</a> off the map and return you'll lose all dialogue choices due to a scripting glitch (the "drive away" strategy is not really recommended for this reason). You can, of course, blow everyone away after the deal is complete, for the combat xp and the stuff in their lockers.</p><aside class="green"><p>The Made Man thing is bugged in more ways than one (in fact, T-Ray is certainly the most heavily bugged person in this game). Firstly, $2700 is taken from your inventory as soon as T-Ray mentions payment (assuming you let him), and if you then offer $1500 or $900 you'll lose that sum in addition to the $2700. It all ends up in T-Ray's inventory, though, so it may not be a problem. If you exit dialogue directly when you lose the $2700 the <a href="#car">Car</a> will be yours, but then you don't get the xp for tricking T-Ray or for the batteries.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can access the trunk while the <a href="#car">Car</a> is still not "yours".</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: You can get to the chop shop by following the <a href="#car">Car</a> tracks, or by following Cody. You can only get the <a href="#car">Car</a> back by driving away or killing everyone, though, so no upgrades for you.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you have already won the game when you buy your <a href="#car">Car</a> back, talk to T-Ray again after getting the trunk upgrade and he'll offer you free "grav-plates" which will make the <a href="#car">Car</a> zoom around the map and reduce fuel consumption to next to nothing. Because of T-Ray's dialogue bug you can't leave the map with the <a href="#car">Car</a> until you've finished the game if you want the grav-plates, or he'll just stare at you stupidly when you come to visit him. (Contrary to popular lore, however, you <em>can</em> have it stolen before then, and even buy it back - as long as you leave it in the chop shop!) A carless game is no fun, so if you're going for the plates it simply means you must never leave your <a href="#car">Car</a> unattended on Virgin Street. One way to go about this is to talk to Jules when you get to New Reno the first time to get Golgotha on the world map, leave the <a href="#car">Car</a> there, return to New Reno on foot and walk to 2nd Street. Now return for the <a href="#car">Car</a>, and for the rest of the game you can park it on any of the other New Reno maps. (A quicker, if not 100% legit way of accomplishing this is to hit 2 through 4 on the New Reno town map instead of making the round trip.) Unless you really want to see the effects of the grav-plates, I'd say a better <a href="#car">Car</a> <em>during</em> the game is much preferable to an even better <a href="#car">Car</a> <em>after</em> the game.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>T-Ray says you can buy batteries from him (and if you're Made Man of the Bishops you're supposed to get them for free), but he never has any. You can hit the barter button in case you want to trade back whatever cash he got from you for junk. In fact there's a scripting bug here so that he checks <em>your</em> inventory for Small Energy Cell or Micro Fusion Cell, so if you carry any of these he'll say he has some batteries to sell - only he doesn't.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Female characters can also keep on making love to T-Ray for the upgrade and/or batteries. This is heavily bugged, and you won't get either although the message window says you do. Keep on making sweet love and T-Ray will blow up, but this causes my game to black out (I hear the "explosion" sounds but my screen stays black after the fade-out). One time, though, I was able to sleep with him repeatedly without even getting the <a href="#car">Car</a> back for my troubles, and after a while of this he blew up properly. Tvoinpyer adds on the blackout: "You can save your game at that moment although you cannot see anything. Press F4 and Enter twice. That should save the game. Then exit the game (<kbd>Ctrl-Q</kbd> followed by <kbd>Y</kbd>), restart <em>Fallout 2</em> and load the saved game. If all goes well it should load the map with T-Ray blown up." The procedure as described will overwrite the first save slot; quicksaving with F6 also works.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-reno3"> <span>Find out who was responsible for Richard Wright's overdose.</span></summary><p>Go to Keith Wright and ask for work. He won't let you in if you're a Berserker or Childkiller or have -101 karma or worse, and you must also pass a Speech check (more difficult for Slavers). You'll get in with a recommendation from Chris Wright at the railway station, but he's got the same standards only he's very strict about the Slaver thing. In any case, talk to Orville Wright. If you maintain Richard may have taken Jet on his own accord, Orville will attack, so don't (Chris is also a bit touchy concerning this matter). Keith Wright will name the usual suspects: Jules, Jimmy J, Little Jesus and Renesco; with IN 7 you can also ask him to tell you which room was Richard's. Go there and search the bookcase inside the door... you'll find a Jet canister behind it, and 500 xp. If you walk around talking to the dealers they all point the finger at each other. But if you show the Empty Jet Canister to Jagged Jimmy J, he can tell you it was poisoned (500 xp), and if you mention this to Renesco, you find out the Salvatores ordered a poisoned canister from him (1000 xp). Another way of going about this is to dig up Richard's grave in Golgotha (which Renesco will put on the map if you ask him about Richard) and examine it to find he was poisoned and then mentioning this to Renesco, for the same total amount of xp (but you'll be a Grave Digger this way, which you may or may not care about). You can confront the Salvatores with this info, but it just leads to a fight.</p><p>Return to Orville. If you opened the grave, don't tell him. Now, you can finger any of the four dealers involved for 500 xp, $250, 2 Booze and 20 Shotgun Shells as long as you've talked to them or heard anyone else name them as suspects. If the person in question is dead already, then Orville will attack. Otherwise the accused person will disappear, and that's that. However, if you tell Orville about the involvement of the Salvatores you get $350, 2 Booze and 40 Shotgun Shells, and if you manage to deduce their motive (IN 7 needed, plus you must know about all the families) you also get 2000 xp. It doesn't matter if Salvatore is dead or not.</p><aside class="green"><p>You can get both the 500 xp for "fingering a suspect" and the 2000 xp for cracking the case if you first say Richard was poisoned, then happen to mention Renesco's name, then tell Orville that Renesco wasn't ultimately responsible for the murder and finally figure out the Salvatores' motive. Renesco won't come to any harm this way, either. Note that you can't do this the other way around, i.e. fingering Renesco and then say the Salvatores were behind him.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you finger Little Jesus, the Mordino family will turn hostile.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you're playing an evil character, one way of getting the Wright quests is to talk to Chris or Keith Wright while you're still not too evil and get permission to talk to Mr Wright. Another, trickier way is to force-feed Keith some alcohol to lower his Perception, enter Sneak mode, open the door and talk to Mr Wright. Take his first quest, finger a suspect you don't like (or go and finish the quest properly if you want), then take the second quest to get the SAD on your world map. Note that you must be sneaking all the time while talking to Orville, since he will attack if he sees you after you open the door without permission.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Turning the Wright family hostile will set this quest to failed even if you already finished it or never got it (in which case it appears crossed out in your Pip-Boy). This has no effect in the game, but may change the ending for this quest as well as (in rare cases) the ending for New Reno.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In the unpatched version you get 2000 additional xp when first saying Richard was poisoned.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-reno4"> <span>Track down Pretty Boy Lloyd, recover the stolen money, and make an... example of him.</span></summary><p>Rule number one: Mason is an arrogant asshole. The temptation to kill him is great, but we need him alive for now. Tell him you have information or want a job to get an audience with Salvatore. You can piss Salvatore off in any number of ways, try not to do that. Before leaving, might as well pick up a Laser Pistol from the footlocker for Eldridge. To find Lloyd you need to go to the basement of the Desperado casino. There are some rats down here, and stuff on the floor... plus one human rat behind a locked door, Mr Lloyd himself. Rule number two: You can't let Lloyd get away alive, or Salvatore will know it and you will be attacked when you return. You can get Lloyd to tell you where the money is buried in Golgotha (which appears on your map), and kill him right away, or get him to come along with you (which is best, requires IN 6). You can intimidate him if you have ST 6, if you're wearing any kind of power or combat armor, if you're a Berserker, or if you have at least one follower. This way you can make him give you his money, and if you let him scamper you can still go and pick up the treasure, but Salvatore won't shower you with flowers.</p><aside class="green"><p>Though Lloyd's bugs are not as obvious and significant as T-Ray's, there are probably even more of them: he has maybe two dozen minor script errors, inconsistencies and redundancies. For instance, following specific routes through the dialogue in town and/or in Golgotha you may be led to the grave but not be able to enter it, or be able to enter it though you haven't heard of it.</p></aside><p>If you came by yourself, walk to the third grave from the right in the top section. (Lloyd's directions don't make any sense and the grave is not marked "Arch Stanton".) Use Traps on it and you get a Plastic Explosive in your inventory. Then use a Shovel (you won't become a Grave Digger) and walk onto the open grave to enter the fallout shelter and collect the $1000. By the way, you can't enter the grave if you come here before talking to Lloyd about it.</p><p>If you came with Lloyd, you can tell him to dig, in which case you get the Plastic Explosive, or you can dig yourself, in which case the bomb goes off in your face and Lloyd attacks, or you can check for traps, in which case you may find the Plastic Explosive or set it off (to find it you should first pass a Sneak check or have IN 7 and Traps 51%, then have Traps 51% or pass a Traps check). If nothing went boom, you can choose to let Lloyd go down first (he attacks when you follow), go down first yourself (he attacks when you come back up, why didn't he make a run for it, the stupid git?), or tell him to go down, then throw the landmine in after him, which is fun ("All in a day's work"), but costs you a Plastic Explosive. If you let him go down and then wait for him to come back up he'll escape somehow, so don't do that.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you already visited Golgotha and used Traps on the grave to get the Plastic Explosives, there'll be another one once you've talked to Lloyd (and the grave will be covered if you dug it up).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you kill Lloyd you lose 10 karma, no matter if he attacked you first. However, if any of your party members deals the final blow, you don't lose any karma. Even more strangely, dropping the landmine on Lloyd only costs you 5 karma.</p></aside><p>If you have Sneak 76% or Sneak tagged, you can tell Lloyd he can take off on his own, then follow him from New Reno to Golgotha. If you pass either a Sneak check or an Outdoorsman check, you'll find Lloyd having retrieved the cash (but not the Plastic Explosives) and making his way down across the map; he'll enter combat immediately when he spots you. If you fail both skill checks, you'll only find an empty fallout shelter and no Lloyd.</p><p>Returning to Mr Salvatore there are a million things you can say to piss him or Mason off, as usual. If you killed Lloyd and give the correct amount to Salvatore you get 500 xp, $500, and the next quest (if Renesco's dead he doesn't have any more work for you).</p><aside class="green"><p>If you talk to Lloyd before getting this quest the dialogue is a bit different (you can tell him to give you his money which amounts to $57, but you'll get it later anyway), but you can get the same results and follow him to Golgotha without the IN 6 requirement. Then when you get the quest you can tell Mason you already took care of Lloyd.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>When talking to Salvatore there's always a respectful line that you get with CH 6 or IN 8 which will make him respect you more, and a coarse line which will not. If you want to get <a href="#quest-reno6">Help guard a secret transaction taking place in the desert</a> and become a Made Man later on you must pick most of the respectful ones.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-reno5"> <span>Go visit Renesco the Rocketman and collect Mr. Salvatore's tribute of $1000.</span></summary><p>Make sure you have plenty of room in your inventory. Go to Renesco and ask for the tribute, keep telling him Salvatore sent you. Don't even consider going back to Salvatore for confirmation, Mason will <em>not</em> be impressed. Also don't threaten with violence or Renesco won't talk to you again. When he says he's broke, suggest that he give you a discount in exchange for you paying the tribute (IN 7 needed), and then tell him you want to see his stuff right away (you won't get another chance). You can now get all his stuff for a song. When you return to Salvatore and give him $1000, you get $250 back ($100 if he doesn't like your manners) and 750 xp, so in the end you get several thousand bucks' worth of equipment for $751. Oh, and before you return for the next Salvatore quest, make sure you've heard from Father Tully or Jules about the "lightbringers".</p><aside class="green"><p>When you enter the barter screen after getting the discount, Renesco's stuff (except the money) may be worth $0 right away. It can also happen that the cost is merely reduced by a factor. In my case that factor was initially 5; however, after I left the barter screen and re-entered by telling him again I wanted to make "purchases", the prices were reduced by a factor of 100 instead (this is because the discount modifier is applied each time you enter that dialogue node). By trading things back and forth, you can quickly and easily get the whole of Renesco's inventory for a mere $1 (including his cash - trade something for it which you can then get back for free).</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Even if you put the $1000 for the tribute in Renesco's inventory, he'll still say he can't afford it. What a dork.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Unlike the quest to get the Corsican Brothers' money for Mordino or getting Becky's money in the Den, you can actually give Salvatore $1000 without even going to see Renesco.

If you know about the laser weapons, you get the opportunity to ask for one, which Salvatore will grant unless he barely trusts you enough to give you the quest. When you talk to Mason (he'll give you 24 hours to prepare, and attack if you're late) tell him Salvatore said to give you a lightbringer and then ask for training. You get a Laser Pistol, and your Energy Weapons skill will go up by 5%. Next you're teleported to the desert meeting place. Some more foreshadowing... a fresher vertibird than the one in Klamath, and those guys look like the one on the monitor in the Gecko power plant. Don't move an inch until you're told you can go, or everyone will start shooting at you. Once the transaction is complete you're free to move wherever you want, but there isn't much to do. Leave the screen and return to Salvatore for 1000 xp. If you turn down his offer to become a Made Man, he'll attack. If you accept, you get another 1000 xp, and you can still attack him if you want, so what's to lose? Then go pick up your "armload" of items from Mason. If Mason <em>and</em> Salvatore like you, you get $300, 80 Small Energy Cell and a Metal Armor Mark II. If Salvatore likes you but Mason doesn't, you get $150 and a Metal Armor. Finally if none of them likes you, you only get lousy $50. In either case you also get a Laser Pistol if you didn't get one before the quest.</p><aside class="green"><p>Winning Mason's approval is easy: just put up with his remarks and don't be snide. Getting Salvatore's respect counter high enough is trickier, since it's not enough simply to follow the dialogue and pick the polite options. The trick is to raise it when you first meet him by saying you have information and using his name, then immediately leave dialogue by saying you're in the wrong room (which amazingly doesn't make him want to see you dead).

Even if I steal his Oxygen Tank and/or plant the Poison Tank there is absolutely no reaction. The only notable thing he does is to stand and wave his arms occasionally. When I get this bug Boss Mordino will claim Salvatore is still alive if I killed Salvatore in combat." The bug triggers if you click on Salvatore after becoming a Made Man, or after being told he has no use for you; at that point his script freezes, failing to set the proper variable if he's killed and making an assassination impossible (you can test this by shooting him once and then checking your character sheet - if you're still a Made Man, the bug is active). If you save and load the game, though, he should be back to "normal" for as long as you don't click on him again, so all is not lost if you happen to set off the bug.</p></aside><aside class="rp"><p>During the desert transaction between the Salvatores and the Enclave, it is now possible to sneak aboard the Vertibird.

Make sure you've done all quests in NCR and Vault City involving Westin, then head over to NCR (which appears on your map) and Westin's ranch. Use the Poison from Doc Jubilee's house or a dose of Jet, Buffout or Psycho on Westin, and he'll have a heart attack.

You also get the option to talk about heart pills, if you manage to steal them or get caught trying to steal them. Don't get your hopes up trying to buy them from him, as it's just not possible.</p><p>After that you can go to Reno and get the 'pecker pills' from Renesco for $200.

When he has raised the price, you can convince him to make them for free if you remind him about the 'Wright affair' or say you helped him with Salvatore (depending on how you handled those quests of course).

Turning on the alarm doesn't release the bots, and actually running the diagnostic test locks up the terminal.

From each of the riflebots you can get a Robot Motivator, and you really want one of those for later.</p><p>You can also set off the alarm on any level by failing to disable or enable a specific forcefield more than two times, or by using your own eye on the retinal scanners.

General robot and turret fighting tip: disabling their sensors with aimed shots takes all the fight out of them.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you release the robots on level 1 then turn off the alarm, they may turn invisible again depending on where they are (the "cloaked" area is a rectangle covering the hidden compartments and the space in between, but not the side corridors). If you disabled the alarm using the terminal they'll keep making floats even if they're not visible.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Attempting to hack the terminal and failing will shut you out permanently from this terminal and the alarm terminal on level 2, and vice versa.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The reason why the alarm terminal doesn't release the bots is actually that it's bugged and sets the wrong variable, so that instead you'll end up with what looks like a permanent RadAway addiction on your character sheet. Though this may be mostly annoying (your Radiation Resistance is unaffected), it does seem to protect you from "real" RadAway addiction.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's possible to get permanently stuck here, as told by David Lünn: "The door to the elevator on level one is open because I opened it earlier but didn't use it, so I don't need the eye, which now has been dropped somewhere on the floor. I enter, and take the elevator to level three. The door shuts behind me, and I'm effectively stuck. I haven't got Dixon's or Clifton's Eye, so I can't access either of the elevators. I haven't got any explosives on me. And, it appears that my puny Repair skill isn't able to bring down the forcefields, no matter how many times I try." A Repair skill of 41% is necessary to have any chance of disabling the forcefields (a Tool will help, but not a Super Tool Kit). Another way to get stuck is to let <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> get you inside the forcefields and wait until they turn back on. Then shoot <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>.</p></aside><p>On level 2 you find a computer next to the left elevator where you can turn off the automated repair system for 200 xp (PE 7 and LK 8 will provide alternatives to a Science check). A critical failure will disable the terminal. Go to the room to the south (Lockpick 100% recommended for the door) and loot all the ammo crates for some serious armor and weaponry, such as a Plasma Rifle and 2 Combat Armors. Don't miss the row of small crates behind the wall.</p><aside class="green"><p>The bots in this room, with one exception, will not fight back if attacked, nor does this alert the other bots on the level. In all they're worth 8250 xp, which isn't so bad when you first get here. The exception is the rocketbot closest to the yellow forcefield. Though your NPCs won't fire on the active bot, they may hit it while trying to burst-fire at something behind it, so you'd better save first. Or put this off until later when you're cleaning out the base for fun and experience.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you want some xp, you can go around using Repair or a Tool on each of the dormant bots. You'll gain either 200 xp (if you succeed and get the message "You seem to have disabled the robot") or 75 xp (if you fail and get the message "You seem to have repaired the robot completely", which will heal the bot if it was damaged). This goes for all bots in the depot except the passive ones in the repair bay. Sometimes, it seems, this can also produce freak messages from other parts of the game. The "disabled" bots will still fight you if it comes to that, though they don't mill about or initiate combat themselves.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Destroyed rocketbots aren't lootable, but you can still search them if there's another, lootable body on the same hex (like a dead riflebot or an unconscious NPC); you can then access the rocketbot by clicking the arrows in the loot interface. Some of them will have Miniguns that you can pick up no matter how the robot was killed. Others will be armed with Robo Rocket Launchers and that's a little trickier; see the Toxic Caves section for how to get hold of these. The passive bots don't have anything.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The repair system doesn't actually do anything if you leave it on (it's related to an unimplemented feature with repair bots).</p></aside><p>The sentrybots won't attack you unless you set off the alarm or attack them. Now in the passages to either side of the laser tripwire there's a row of traps, but the tripwire itself doesn't do anything. Near the top of the level you'll find a "hidden" searchable crate which contains rockets and grenades. In the room on the middle right you find a Cookie, a rare item (of the kind which you never end up using). The alarm computer in the middle of the level works mostly like the corresponding one on level 1. If you activate the alarm you can turn it off twice (using the "hack" and "attempt to turn off" options) and gain 500 xp and 550 xp respectively. Hacking requires IN 8 and you should have Science 80-90% before attempting this, and save first (with Science 106% you'll automatically succeed, though). With PE 7 you can deactivate the alarm by running the self-diagnostic program, but it gives no experience.</p><p>The computer at the bottom right is a bit trickier as it seems to be slightly bugged. Reading the mail does nothing except that if you read the "penpal greetings", the computer is infected with a virus and becomes inoperational. You can hack the forcefields, in which case you get 200 xp and the shock plates turn off, but the forcefields stay in place (bugged, as I said). Hacking the shock plates does exactly the same thing (but you cannot get the xp twice; also if you disable the shock plates then try again and fail, they turn back on). Science 90% will let you pass the skill checks; failing critically will disable the terminal. You can guess the password to the forcefields, in which case they turn off (no xp). Lastly you can try to guess the password for the shock plates, which apparently cannot be done even with LK 10.</p><p>Onwards to level 3. To access the new elevator you have to use Clifton's Eye instead (which also gives clearance for the other elevator), and this is located in the wall locker in the far northeast room. When you access the alarm computer on this level it doesn't behave like the other ones due to an override. Don't tell it you're Dixon, or the robots will turn hostile on levels 1-3 and the four alarm computers plus the password computer on level 1 will zap you for some damage if you try to use them again. If you tell it your name or that you're a friend, this will turn off the alarm for this level.</p><p>In the left branch of the T-junction there are two traps to watch out for. Talk to Skynet the artificial intelligence by accessing the terminal by the large mainframe. It will ask you to help it "escape" from the depot. You can ask it to reset the security systems, which means that any hostile robots in the depot turn dormant again but not much more. If you say "It's nice to want" then the same thing will happen as when you tell it you're Dixon (but if you have Speech 76% you can apologize and prevent this).</p><aside class="green"><p>If you anger Skynet, then talk to it again and agree to help, it'll turn the alarm off for level 3 but at the same time turn it on for levels 1-2, to encourage you to stay and finish the job. Angering Skynet is the only way to release the four rocketbots inside the wall on level 3, and like the robots on level 1, they can turn magically invisible when called off. The robots inside the wall on level 4 are never released; there aren't even any secret door scripts in place. In the unpatched version the conditions for opening the sliding panels on level 3 corresponded to the general alarm state of the depot, but they were then made floor-specific leading to the state of things as described above.</p></aside><p>On the top left is your science fair project, but it's unfinished. To get the robot functioning you must do three things:</p><ul><li>Use a Robot Motivator on it. The easiest way to get one of these is on level 1, but every riflebot in the depot has one.</li><li>Use a Bio Med Gel on it. There's one right there on the floor, I guess the designers felt sorry for those who might have failed to hold on to the one found on level 1.</li><li>Use a Brain on it. You get these on level 4. The quality of your new robot will depend on the quality of the brain used. You get 500 xp for installing the brain no matter which one it is.</li></ul><p>If you activate the robot before it is complete, it simply explodes. Now, if you used the Abnormal Brain or the Chimpanzee Brain, you get a stupid robot who can only carry stuff and nothing else. The chimpanzee is actually smarter because you can tell it to wait somewhere, whereas you have to kill the abnormal bot if you want it out of your party. The Human Brain will create a mediocre sniper (which cannot level up), but to get the real Skynet with auto repair systems you need the Cybernetic Brain. See the NPC section for more details on the <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a>.</p><aside class="green"><p>Once you "extract" Skynet, the alarm computers plus the password computer on level 1 will stop functioning, so you may want to get whatever xp you can out of them first.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you manage to piss off Skynet (by telling it you're Dixon or being sarcastic) and then use the Cybernetic Brain on the robot, it won't thank you. Once you exit the depot it will kill one of your other NPCs instantly (but not <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>, <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> or any dog), then attack. If you assemble the bot before talking to Skynet at all then it will be friendly, even if you had triggered the alarm on level 3. Evil Skynet will join you over the party limit. Sebastian Cassten reports that you can get evil Skynet in your party permanently: enter combat mode directly after leaving the depot and run back inside (or towards the red exit grid). If you leave the map without Skynet going hostile it'll hang around for good, forever talking about "proceeding to the surface". It will level up as usual and you can access its combat control screen (allowing you to arm and disarm it by changing its weapon preferences), but not tell it to stay put or repair itself.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 you get no xp for installing the brain.</p></aside><p>On level 4, the alarm computer is offline. Not much to do here except extract organs and get things from storage. To extract a brain (as the Experiment Holodisk will tell you, the device extracts only brains no matter what organ you select), place a party member in the room with the extractor (he or she must still be in your party), and tell the computer to get extractin'. Your NPC will get hit for lots of damage and die, and a Human Brain shows up. You get 500 xp for attempting your first brain extraction, even if there's no one in the extraction chamber.</p><aside class="green"><p>You cannot use the extractor on <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a>, <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a>, <a href="#npcs--robodog">Robodog</a>, or the <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a> unless it has the best brain. Isn't it a little weird that you get a human brain out after you put in a cybernetic one?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You lose 100 karma each time you kill someone this way. Oh, so this is more evil than going after a kid with a rocket launcher?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If more than one NPC are in the extraction chamber, they all die but you get no brain. It's kinda funny to hear them screaming in synch, though.</p></aside><p>North of there is the storage area. Use the computer, choose "cadavers" and Private Dobbs. Talk to him and look at him go. You can pick up a LE Red Ryder BB Gun from his remains, but you don't get this if you kill him before he melts. Odd. If he doesn't run, you need to shut down the forcefield.</p><p>You can also get a brain from here, which is probably a better idea than using the organ extractor unless you actually want someone killed. Depending on your Science skill you'll end up with from zero to four brains from which you get to choose one. With Science 90% you can get the Human Brain about 50% of the time. To get the Cybernetic Brain you need Science 121%, but there's still a small risk of failure, so save first. Once you get a brain the storage retrieval bot blows up, which means you should get Dobbs first.</p><aside class="green"><p>You can't get any organ except for brains. If you retrieve a virus, any virus, the vial will break and you have one minute to leave the depot before dying (the countdown says four, but it's bugged). Even if you get out you'll die immediately if you ever come back in.</p></aside></article><hr><article class="rp"><h2 id="epa">EPA <a class="header-link" href="#epa">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/epa-b3a63513.jpg"></picture><p>There's three ways of getting this location on your map. First is by recruiting <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> and then try to dump him, he will then tell you of this location. The second way is from a random traveler somewhere close to New Reno, and the third way is by doing a quest for Dr. Sheng (See the San Francisco section). You will need a rope here, so don't forget to bring one.</p><p>When you arrive you will be greeted by a horde of spore plants spread out on most of the map. If you are alone you can easily cruise in between them, but if you have a party with you, they might want to run around and take them all out. It can be a pretty long fight.</p><p>To the left of the entrance you will find a white shed containing some useful items like a can of plant spray. If you equip it and use it on a plant it will die instantly. If you run out you can find another can in the garage (storage shed) just north of the shed, but unless your lockpicking skill is high you will have to wait with it until later. In one of the lockers inside the white shed you can also find a big metal pole, you might want to grab it (you never know when one might come in handy). There's also several pieces of junk spread out on the map, feel free to grab one.</p><p>The locked storage shed contains a few odds and ends but nothing special except for one thing, if you have <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a> in your party and like to keep him alive that is. There are some cans of dog food there. Use the dog food on <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a> and he regains full health when injured. (I don't know whether it works like the first aid kit and disappears randomly after using it, or if it lasts forever.)</p><p>When you enter the main building you will notice that the elevators are broken but luckily you can go down through the right elevator shaft. All you need is a bit of rope... Note that Skynet and all of the dogs cannot go down with you, but they will wait for you here until you come back. Oh, and there's a locker with some stimpaks on the left side of the main building and a computer giving you a little bit of information on all the levels of the EPA, otherwise nothing much of interest.</p><p>Going down the elevator shaft will take you to EPA's Air, Water and Power Facility level. It's crawling with rats, mantis and small scorpions. There's a few of lockers here containing a super toolkit, an electronic lockpick and a couple of books. Going through here you might notice that one of the four power generators is not working properly, though you don't know quite why so you better leave it. On the northern wall there are three big vents, if you go close to the middle one you'll find out that it's just big enough to squeeze through. Only problem is that big spinning metal fan. Here's where that metal pole comes in handy, use it to jam the fan.</p><p>The vent leads you to the maintenance level which has two working elevators, on to the north-west and one to the north-east. The only point's of interests here are a locker with a laser pistol and a depressed Mr Handy robot walking around.</p><p>Here's the layout of the EPA sub-levels (shamelessly copied and modified from SoldierOfTruth):</p><p>East Elevators with appropriate sub levels - Abbreviated by the letter E and followed by the number of the sub-level:</p><ul><li>E1 - Red Level, East Sub-level 1</li><li>E2 - Violet Level, East Sub-level 2</li><li>E3 - Green Level, East Sub-level 3</li></ul><p>West Elevators with appropriate sub levels - Abbreviated by the letter W and followed by the number of the sub-level:</p><ul><li>W1 - Orange level, West Sub-level 1</li><li>W2 - Yellow level, West Sub-level 2</li><li>W3 - Indigo level, West Sub-level 3</li></ul><p>There's also mention of a Blue Level, but it doesn't exist. Or does it?</p><p>I suggest starting with the Orange level (conference rooms and cafeteria).</p><p>To the west you see four holograms arguing with each other seemingly stuck in a loop and you can't talk to them. As you get closer you notice the humming from a magnetic field nearby that might be interfering with them. In the room to the left of them there are a couple of computers. Use the left one and run a diagnostics check, then use repair on it (over 40%) for 100xp. You can now talk to the holograms and get a few quests.</p><p>The Yellow level is connected with the Violet level via a room full of chemicals that is very toxic. It is much better to enter that room from the Violet level than the Yellow, unless you are already wearing protective gear.</p><p>There are no quests in the Indigo Level, but there are a few things of interest.</p><p>In the room directly south of the elevator there is a beeping computer. It holds a few interesting notes, especially the ones on a cure for epilepsy. After you have gotten that info you can 'cure' the barking man in New Reno (100xp and 3 Stimpaks). If you push the "keep searching" option 22 times you will eventually find info on a Mass Fluoridation Project (200xp). With Luck 9 you can find the hidden message a little faster.</p><p>The room just below the computer holds three modified auto-doc machines. Using these will let you change your appearance. As a male you can go from normal hair, to long hair, to completely bald. You can even have that sex-change operation you've always dreamt about. Females can change between blonde, red head and the normal 'bucket head' brunette, plus the sex change. For now... but more hero models are in the works for both men and women, just hope they find their way to the RP when done. Warning: The machines can be very dangerous! Saving prior to use is advisable.</p><p>In a room to the far left is a silver toaster sitting on a desk. Apparently his name is "Brave Little Toaster". You can have a little chat with him. It turns out he's desperate to make you a toast, as it's been a century since he last made any. But that's not why you are here. As everything else here he is in need of repairs (fairly easy repair roll, 450xp), and if you talk to him again you gain the ability to jinx slot machines. A handy little perk to have if you are in need of cash, as when you use it a slot machine will surrender all its money.</p><p>Most doors on the Red Level are locked and needs to be opened with the key card you get from the director of security. In the room below the elevator is yet another broken hologram, which leads to the quest to fix the hologram thet speaks static.</p><p>The Violet Level is pretty empty but this is where you find the elevator down to the Blue level. Also, in the small wall locker in the hallway to the contaminated area you will find a gas mask. If you equip it in your active item slot you will be protected from toxins and can enter the chemical areas safely (the one on this level is the only one you really need to enter). Note that this contaminated room could just as well have been covered in the Yellow level section, but since the gas mask can be found in this level it fits better here.</p><p>To the right of the big computer you can see two fans that are clogged up with goo. Clean them for 50xp each and the air becomes breathable (you no longer need the gas mask).</p><p>The big computer here is "Mr. Chemmie", the local candy man. Well, not really. But if you have the knowledge and the right ingredients, he can create almost any drug you want. He can make:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Drug</th><th scope="col">Ingredients</th><th scope="col">Skill level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td scope="col">Stimpaks</td><td>Broc flower, Xander root, Empty hypo</td><td></td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Super stimpaks</td><td>Stimpak, Fruit, Nuka-Cola</td><td></td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Poison</td><td>Empty hypo, Scorpion tail, Nuka-Cola</td><td>Science 41%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Poison antidote</td><td>Scorpion tail, Booze</td><td>Science 46%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">First aid kit</td><td>Stimpak, empty hypo, Poison antidote, rad away</td><td>Science 56%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Doctor's bag</td><td>Stimpak, empty hypo, Poison antidote, First aid kit</td><td>Science 61%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Buffout</td><td>First aid kit, Beer, Nuka-Cola</td><td>Science 71%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Mentats</td><td>First aid kit, Fruit, Booze</td><td>Science 81%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Psycho</td><td>Mentats, Buffout, Fruit, Stimpak</td><td>Science 86%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Rad-X</td><td>First aid kit, Nuka-Cola</td><td>Science 86%</td></tr><tr><td scope="col">Rad away</td><td>Nuka-Cola, Empty hypo, Stimpak</td><td>Science 91%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There is also some special options:</p><dl><dt>Heart Pills</dt><dd>If you have <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> in your party and science 101%, you can make these.

Need to know about it before you get the option to make it.</dd></dl><p>There are some books and drugs in the lockers in this level.</p><p>At the Green Level you can find EPA's botanical garden and the spectacular petting zoo. The zoo could be seen as a bit controversial, as it holds humans too. Deformed and crazed from genetic experimentation.</p><p>There are no quests here, but there is one quest objective you can fulfill. On the east side there is a computer, the EPA's botany terminal. On it you can find a file on botany. If you have the quest from Brother Paul to find info on such things, you can download it to a holodisk and bring it to him. You can also extract some seeds from the seed storage tanks. They contain modified corn and some experimental seeds.</p><p>If you are up for it you can take a stroll in the lush trees and bushes of the garden. If you have some seeds you can even grow one yourself. The experimental seeds can be planted in the fertile ground in the south-west corner of the garden (100xp). If you come back three days later you will find a new random bush there (sometimes it's a spore plant).</p><p>You can plant the modified corn in Arroyo for 100xp, but it won't change anything for the village. It must be done before the fourth dream of course. The experimental seeds can be planted here too. I only managed to plant one package of seeds here even though there seems to be more fertile ground available for planting.</p><p>You can read up on the different critters on the computers near their cells and lower the force fields holding them in. They are all hostile though, so the best thing you can do is probably to put them out of their misery.</p><p>The Blue Level is the secret level of the EPA that officially is non-existent. You get down here by an elevator on the Violet level, but first you need the password that is given to you by a hologram on the Red level.</p><p>When you get down here you will exit on a platform surrounded by a pack of wanamingos. If you paid attention to the hole in the wall in the wanamingo holding cell on the Green level, well, this is where they escaped to. If you stand around for too long they will walk through a hole in the fence and attack.</p><p>The big force field that is blocking your way up ahead can be lowered by using repair on the computer to the right of it. You need a pretty high skill here, repair 100% will give you an overall chance of 20%. You can try however many times you like though. A well placed explosive in front of the computer can accomplish the same thing if you aren't skilled enough.</p><p>Up the stairs you will find a room with three hibernation chambers. They all contain possible NPC recruits. The computer just inside the door has information on all of them and from here you can extract one of them. Whom it will be is up to you. When the computer warns that you need a can of ERSI, you can run up to Mr Chemmie to get one, or you can just ignore it and see what happens. Mr Chemmie cannot create the ERSI up until now, no matter what your skill.</p><p>Behind every hibernation chamber is a locker for each NPC. When you extract a NPC from the chamber his or her locker will also be unlocked. The other lockers will remain locked and there is no way for you to open them.</p><p>Do not miss to check out the footlocker in this room, it contains amongst other things a special syringe. When used you gain a permanent +1 AG.</p><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="epa--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#epa--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-epa1"> <span>Fix EPA lighting problem.</span></summary><p>You get this quest from the director of public relations (female holo), but first you have to try to open one of a few password protected doors, and ask her for the password.

'Using' this map will put the locations of the 3 safe houses on your world map.</p></aside><p>Upon arrival in the NCR bazaar - the area outside the city walls - you find Doofus, the <a href="#car">Car</a> hop. You can pay him $5 to watch your <a href="#car">Car</a>, but it's a waste of money. From the second time you enter this map, if you find Doofus raving about cars, you can get him to mention the name of Merk, or if you have the Speaker perk you can tell him to give you his stuff, which amounts to about $30 and 3 Fruits.</p><p>Buster who runs the store in the bazaar will give you one warning and then attack if you come into his store at night, and unlike most other shops he only opens at 8.01. His three shelves all have different contents. This is one of two shops in the game that carry valuable 2mm EC ammo, and Buster also sells Micro Fusion Cell, good Needler ammo and 4.7mm Caseless. If you have surplus weaponry you might want to trade it in for a Pancor Jackhammer, the best shotgun in the game, or a Ripper, Power Fist or Avenger Minigun. He'll also turn a Hunting Rifle into a scoped one for $500. That's exactly the difference in value between the two weapons, which leaves you with a profit of 10 .223 FMJ. Buster's shelves restock separately in 2-4 days except the one on the right which restocks in 1-4 days.</p><aside class="green"><p>Buster's guards carry Bozars which you can steal. I don't 'cause it's silly, plus at this point in the game I wouldn't meet the ST requirement. If you really want one you should be able to take a hike to the Toxic Caves. Speaking of stealing, with a high skill you can use Steal on the shelves and take any amount of stuff from them right in front of Buster. I would have to say this is even sillier.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>As found by Jonathan Cook, if you press 0 when talking to Buster, he'll swap his own inventory with that of the current shelf (which is randomly selected if you just talk to him). This will allow you to steal some stuff directly from him if you are so inclined.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In the department of useless stuff we have the fact that you can go behind Buster's store, go left along the very top of the map until you hit the edge, then work your way down by scrolling and clicking on ahead. You can get as far as south of the saloon, but have to return the same way.</p></aside><p>On the 11th of every odd month, a guy named Stanwell will offer you a job guarding a brahmin caravan to Redding, which pays $2000 but takes a lot of time. Note that this has nothing to do with Duppo's brahmin drive quest.</p><p>The hooded guy on the left of the bazaar map will fit a blower to your <a href="#car">Car</a> for $1000 if you give him six hours to do it. You really should. You can barter some stuff to him to get your money back, and pay him $5 for worthless rumours. You don't actually need to spend six hours in NCR for him to finish the job, but after six hours have passed you must spend about a minute on this map (resting 10 minutes will do it) before he's done.</p><p>You can buy Booze from Mira in the Rawhide Saloon, and ask her for information. The bar patrons may have 200 Shotgun Shells each for you to steal if you like (every time you enter the map there's a chance they'll "restock"). <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> is just obnoxious.</p><p id="fake-vault-13">Merk who hangs out in the back room of the bar between 16.01 and 08.00 is the man with the plan around here. Sometimes he'll be flanked by two guards, sometimes not; presumably they're always supposed to be there since Merk may refer to them even if they're not present. If you want information, you'll have to pay $50 before you even get to ask anything. If you ask about the G.E.C.K. he doesn't know anything, and if you ask him about Vault 13 he tries to sell you a Vault 13 Holodisk for $1000. Buying this disk puts Vault 13 on your map - only once you get there it's just a cave with some construction signs, and when you leave it reads "Fake Vault 13" on your world map. Complaining with Merk helps little, but you can steal the money back. Fun but useless. Instead ask Merk for work. Now you have to prove yourself to him:</p><ul><li>One option is to fight <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> the super mutant alone in a secret basement, limited to these weapons: Knife, Club, Sledgehammer, Spear, Rock, Crowbar, Brass Knuckles, Super Sledge, Ripper, Cattle Prod, Spiked Knuckles, Power Fist, Combat Knife, Sharpened Spear. To get this you must have "talked" to <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> at least once. To make it a lot easier you could steal <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>'s Stimpaks and Power Fist before the fight. Mira gives you a Booze if you talk to her afterwards.</li><li>If you have <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> in your party, tell Merk you know someone who can make Jet. Merk then offers to take <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> off your hands for $1000. (If you choose the "can't do anything illegal" line, Merk won't like you any more.) Due to a bug, <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> still stays in your party.</li><li>Tell Merk you're a "badass mofo" if you're a Childkiller or Berserker.</li><li>Take <a href="#quest-ncr9">Kill Hubologist in NCR for Merk</a>. If you already killed the Hubologist, Merk will act as if you did it for him.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>If you have a Bag o' stuff, you must drop it before going to fight <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>. This is because the Bag is one of the items taken from you - and when you get it back, it's empty! Also guns will be loaded when returned, and if you had separate heaps of the same weapon (with different number of bullets in them, or in your active item slots) you will find yourself with a greater number of guns than you started out with. This is because the script counts all remaining objects when removing each stack; for instance, if you had eight Desert Eagles of which one was in an item slot you'd end up with fifteen after the fight, the script seeing eight before removing the first, then counting the remaining seven. Imagine that... a bug.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Some NPCs won't be hidden by the game when you enter the ring, and will fight <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> with you: <a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a>, <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a>, <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, the pariah dog, <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> or any inferior <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a>. If they die, stuff left on their corpses when you leave the basement is lost.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Don't save the game during your fight with <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>, since if you have to reload you will be stuck in the ring after you kill him. The same kind of bug apparently plagued the ring fights in New Reno and San Francisco in the unpatched version. Although the readme says they're fixed I would still advise against saving during any ring fight.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The fake vault location changes after you leave it for the first time, so any items dropped in there will be lost. More importantly, your <a href="#car">Car</a> will disappear if you drive there and leave on foot.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Saving and/or loading the game while Merk is walking somewhere may cause him to stop and go silent, or teleport him to his destination, depending on the time and location. Leaving the map and returning or resting for a few hours will get him unstuck if necessary.</p></aside><p>Should you annoy Merk in any way, you need CH 7 to talk to him about work again. Once Merk thinks more highly of you, he'll give you <a href="#quest-ncr3">Retrive papers from Dr Henry</a>.</p><aside class="green"><p>There's an infinite money bug here if you like to exploit those (and didn't get enough money from the refinery bug in Broken Hills). Unless you've killed the Hubologist, you can ask Merk for more work after completing <a href="#quest-ncr3">Retrive papers from Dr Henry</a>, and then fight <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> (if you didn't already), or sell <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> for yet another $1000, and yet another $1000, and so on, until you either agree to kill the Hubologist or kill her anyway.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you got Merk's name from Doofus and tell him you've heard he's the man to talk to, he'll refuse to talk to you until you kill Doofus. Doing so changes nothing, so don't choose this dialogue path.</p></aside><p>Read the notice board in the bazaar to learn the NCR ground rules. If you come here at night the forcefields will be up, so either use Repair on the emitters (the guard doesn't mind), or talk to the woman in the guardhouse to get in. Don't even touch her lockers, because she will turn hostile even if she doesn't attack right away (though you should be safe as long as you don't walk right up to her, and I think you can loot the bookcase with impunity). The guard outside the entrance will tell you to put away your guns if you have them ready. Tell all your party members to do so - these guards are serious. If you walk around with guns ready in downtown NCR they'll attack almost immediately. Moving out of sight of a cop doesn't help once you've been warned; you must either put the weapon away or leave the map. The gate guard will attack if you hang around with a weapon after being warned, but oddly enough you can kill both guards in the bazaar and the downtown guards won't know you did it.</p><aside class="green"><p>Make a habit of never going directly to the downtown map when you enter NCR unless you're absolutely sure your NPCs aren't wielding weapons. Once you're there you have very little time to tell them to put their weapons away. On the Council map you start some distance from the nearest cop, so that's OK, and on Westin's ranch they don't care. The three inferior <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a>s are not checked for weapons, but at the same time the cops are probably laughing at you for being stuck with bad NPCs.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Some say <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>' Claw poses a problem when moving around in NCR; however, the cops' script doesn't check for his presence (it's the same with and without the patch), and testing shows no reaction at all.</p></aside><p>Check out both tables at Duppo's (restock in 1-6 days, but there's no money to speak of). You could get a HK P90c for <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and a Combat Armor for yourself if you have the spare weaponry to trade in. He also sells Power Fists for you to upgrade in New Reno. Duppo will give you <a href="#quest-ncr14">Complete brahmin drive</a> if you ask for work. To enter the craps hall, you need at least Gambling 51%, and you must not have accepted <a href="#quest-ncr14">Complete brahmin drive</a> yet. Ask Duppo for work, then ask if there's another way to make a quick buck. Depending on your Speech you can pay him from $100 to $500 for the password to the door, but it's not much fun in there (Den-style craps table, you can steal $1000 from the croupier). If you have ST 9 you can take a Crowbar to the door instead.</p><aside class="yellow"><p>If you're the kind of player who likes to kill shopkeepers for their wares, take care, because after Duppo dies you may not be able to access his tables any more (save first and see). I don't know if this is a common occurrence.</p></aside><p>The lockers in the police station hold various weapons and ammo, but if you try to pick them the guards will attack without warning. Sheriff Dumont and Deputy Karl both carry Gauss Rifles, one of the best weapons in the game... so you might want to steal their ammo.</p><p>If you approach Dorothy, the woman outside the building northeast of the police station, during daylight hours she'll ask for help dealing with a madman with a bomb. The lunatic in question is Jack, a policeman whose ex-wife Mira is the green-haired woman in the bazaar. If you tell Dorothy it's not your business you can still go in and talk to Jack, but it gives you a little less time to initiate dialogue. There are several things that can happen now:</p><ul><li>Talk Jack out of it, if you have Speech 80% or the Speaker perk. The easiest dialogue path here is 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 (there's only one node where it doesn't matter what you say). If you succeed, you earn 6000 xp. Talk to Dorothy for another 3000 xp (although it doesn't say on your screen), a Big Book of Science, a Scout Handbook, a First Aid Book and a Deans Electronics.</li><li>Wait for Jack to begin his routine ("Bite me! This is Jack!") and blast him with a couple of Jackhammer bursts at point blank range. Watch out - if you don't kill him, he'll shoot back! Tell Dorothy there was no alternative to killing him, and you get the books and 3000 xp. If you tell her there <em>was</em> a way to avoid bloodshed, you don't get anything except loot from Jack.</li><li>Let him blow up, then repair the bank of monitors on the wall (not the nearby computer) with either Science or Repair. (You can do this even if you don't get the option to tell Dorothy you're good at repairing things, which requires Repair 65%.) You'll get the 3000 xp and books reward, plus the stuff you find in Jack's body parts.</li><li>Let him blow up, then stand back and watch as Dorothy fails to repair the computer. She <em>may</em> die in the resulting explosion, in which case you can pick up a Scout Handbook and Deans Electronics from the ground, but as you can imagine you get no other reward for this. The forcefields to Westin's and Carlson's estates go down... but if you enter the Westin map without permission from the guard you have to kill him (no one else cares), and if you enter Carlson's yard without permission you have to fight an entire mapful of guards, which is bad, so there's no point to any of this.</li></ul><p>If Jack lives, you can find him in a cell in the police station, raving. Strangely he's still got weaponry in his inventory. If he dies, however, <a href="#quest-ncr13">"Take care of Officer Jack" for Mira</a> pops up in your Pip-Boy (see below).</p><aside class="green"><p>If you don't wait until Jack begins talking before shooting him, Dorothy and/or the guards may attack you.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you steal the two books Dorothy is carrying before getting the reward, she only gives you the two (Science and First Aid manuals) she is not.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can repair the computer before anything else happens, and talk to Dorothy for her xp and book reward. If Jack then damages the computer and you fix it again, she'll give you another 3000 xp and two more books.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In the unpatched version you could get infinite rewards from Dorothy by using Repair on the computer repeatedly and talking to her in between.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Funny detail: as Jack blows up, during the death animation you can click on his body parts flying through the air and get more of Jack's spoken lines from them. You can shoot at them, too - but if you don't kill him he may pull himself together and shoot back!</p></aside><p>When you come to NCR for the first time you should head right over to the Hubologist in the church downtown. You want two things from her: <a href="#quest-ncr8">Deliver Hubologist's field report to AHS-9 in San Francisco</a> and the zeta scan. Getting the scan will either raise your Luck by 2 or lower it by 1; both permanently, so save first and decide which you want. It also makes you an AHS-1 Hubologist, which has basically no effect in the game except that you can't get the slightly different zeta scan in San Francisco. If you manage to offend her she won't talk to you any more.</p><aside class="green"><p>If your LK is 1 and gets lowered, it will remain at 1 but if you later get the Gain Luck perk it won't do anything (since technically it will raise the Luck variable from 0 to 1). This goes for the zeta scan in San Francisco as well, of course.</p></aside><p>The doctor in the hospital will not sell you Stimpaks, but you can take stuff from his bookcase. If you fail a Steal check Doc Jubilee will notice if you take the Heart Pills and/or Poison hypo and make you put them back. However, if you put the two items in your inventory and then drop them from within the loot interface, he'll be completely oblivious after you pick them up again. Talk to the doctor and ask about Vault 13 to have him mention a certain Saltbeef. He will always charge $50 for healing, heals only HP and cannot heal NPCs.</p><p>Leave your party members behind before going into Dusty's Cantina. There's an obnoxious guy in the corner named Hoss who'll provoke you into a fight when you walk up to him. Beat him down to 23 HP, or just put a gun in your active item slot, and he backs down. Afterwards Dusty will give you a free Booze every time you talk to him. If your party members are nearby they'll draw their weapons and may bring the guards down on you, which is why they shouldn't be around. If you're somehow too weak to handle Hoss you can end the fight by running to the nearby exit grid.</p><p>The guy outside the Brotherhood building (which is empty) is as useless as the one in the Den unless your level is 9 or below, in which case he'll answer one question.</p><p>To get to Westin's ranch to the west you can either talk to Dumont about work and get a recommendation, or have <a href="#quest-vc6">Deliver Lynette's holodisk to Westin in NCR</a>. In the nearest building inside you find Saltbeef, the old drunk. Giving him a Beer or similar (except for Rot Gut) you can get him to tell you about how he found Vault 13 and how he scribbled a map on the back of a painting, which is now in the possession of doctor Jubilee. Jubilee will sell the painting for a whooping $10,000 (which you can steal back). Once you have the painting, examine it and Vault 13 shows up on your world map. This is not really necessary even for diplomatic characters.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The guard will let you into Westin's estate if you choose the "Uh..." line.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you want to get out from Westin's estate and Grant met with an accident or something, use Science or Repair on the computer by the gate, or blow it up with Dynamite. Although you can get 50 xp by using Repair on the forcefield emitter, you can't disable it this way. The cops downtown won't react if you slaughtered the people on the ranch.</p></aside><p>In the Council Hall area there's just the Congress House and Carlson's estate. See <a href="#quest-ncr12">Retrive Parts/Gain Access to Vault 15</a> for the former. To get into Carlson's place you can do two things. One is to steal the Presidential Pass off Gunther in the Congress House and use it (backpack icon) on the guard at Carlson's gate before talking to him. The other is to talk to Merk and ask about Carlson (will cost you $50), and if he likes you (which requires that you've performed <a href="#quest-ncr3">Retrive papers from Dr Henry</a> for him and didn't piss him off) he'll tell you there may be a job for you as a bodyguard for Carlson. Now go to Carlson's estate and talk to the guard, he'll let you pass. Actually, a third way is to use Repair on the forcefield emitter, but if you enter without permission everyone will start shooting.</p><aside class="green"><p>Merk (and possibly his two henchmen) will reside in the north wing from 8.00 to 12.00 and in the vestibule from 12.01 to 16.00. If you try to talk to him in his room he'll shoo you out and attack if you stick around, unless you're a Porn Star (of either gender). Carlson's guards don't care if you kill him.</p></aside><p>You can tell Carlson's kid to ask Carlson if you can see him; if you mention Bishop's name the kid will say you can come in, but Carlson still won't talk to you. The guards outside the door, on the other hand, always say that Carlson is ready to see you. No matter. To kill Carlson, use 5 Super Stimpaks on him and wait 10 minutes, or else you can open the gate to his garden, go round the house and shoot him through the window (actually just standing in the back of his room works too). Save first, and you may have to make sure the kid is on the other side of the yard (he can be pushed). You could do a Sneak-kill as well. When he's dead, might as well pick up his Pancor Jackhammer.</p><aside class="green"><p>Strap: "I always loved assassinating Carlson in the NCR by planting explosives on his kid and sending him in to see his daddy."</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>There's a rumour that the Shiv can be used for this assassination, but it actually can't. I suppose what keeps this rumour around is that there's a certain logic to it: the Shiv is a non-detectable weapon and NCR is the place where you're not allowed to brandish weapons, and what else would you use a Shiv for but an assassination?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>NCR is another area with lots of empty containers. If I'm not mistaken the only stuff you can find in the downtown area is: map in Ranger HQ, Dr Henry's papers, some stuff in Dusty's Cantina, and Doc Jubilee's bookcase. Except for Duppo's wares, of course, and the locked containers in the police HQ that you have to kill everyone to get to. The council and ranch areas are completely empty.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="ncr--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#ncr--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details class="rp"><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-ncr1"> <span>Wipe out the Rangers' safe houses to the north, for Vortis the slaver.</span></summary><p>If you are a slaver, have a karma of less than -250 or if you have the cult of personality perk, you get this quest from Vortis when you deliver the Ranger's map to him. Travel to all the safe houses and take them out for a $1000. If you have speech over 80% you can ask for some assistance in taking them out (there's a speech roll here so sometimes you won't get any help).</p><p>This is preferable since you are then transported automatically between the safe houses (even though Vortis men only seem to stick around for the first fight).</p><p>If they are with you, you also get the option to double-cross them and side with the rangers. Vortis won't know and the rangers will stay alive until you decide otherwise, but this option is mostly for good guys with the cult of personality perk I guess.</p></details><details class="rp"><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-ncr2"> <span>Wipe out the Slaver Camp to the north west, for the Rangers.</span></summary><p>You can learn the location from Metzger (speech 61%) or from one of his slaves after you've freed them. Both require that you have talked to <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and gotten the "Find <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>'s sister"quest first. You then have the choice of going directly to the camp to wipe it out, or going to NCR and tell the Rangers about it. You can persuade the Rangers to assist you if you need some extra help taking care of business. Either way you do it, report back to the Rangers for 800 XP.</p><p>Note: If you give the map to Vortis (to fulfill his quest), the Rangers at the safe houses will all be dead when you arrive (unless you start his second quest but don't finish it). It's possible to wipe out the Ranger safe houses first, before joining the Rangers and get their help in taking out Metzger's slave camp (possible bug?). You may encounter angry Rangers, even if you joined the Rangers, killed Vortis, and have otherwise been playing a good character.</p><p>It is now possible to enter the BOS bunker here, after you have delivered the vertibird plans to Matthew in San Francisco. There are a couple of lockers in there containing a brotherhood armor, a sniper rifle, some ammo and meds.</p></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-ncr3"> <span>Retrive papers from Dr Henry.</span></summary><p>When you return to Merk after <a href="#quest-ncr9">Kill Hubologist in NCR for Merk</a>, you'll get the option to take this job (you only get one chance to accept, unless you choose the "information" line, in which case you get another chance). When you return with the papers (just "retrive" them from the desk at the doctor's place) you get 1000 xp and $1000. If for some inscrutable reason you killed Dr Henry Merk will attack after giving you the reward, and <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> and Mira will join him in the fight (with CH 9 you can pay him $500 to let you go... yeah, right).</p></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-ncr4"> <span>Test mutagenic serum on a super-mutant. Try Broken Hills.</span></summary><p>Talk to Dr Henry with at least Science 80%, ask about cyber-genetics and he'll ask you to inject a super mutant with a prototype serum. Well, find a super mutant and use it on them, and the mutant melts into a puddle of bones and goo (1000 xp). Seems Dr Henry has to work some on his cyber-genetics skills. Return to Dr Henry ("He's dead, Jim") and you get Cyberdog for an NPC if you want, but you probably don't.</p><aside class="green"><p>For some reason I think Elmo in Broken Hills makes for a suitable test subject. If you're evil, you can use the serum on Gond in the Ranger hideout. The other Rangers will attack, but the guards don't mind if you kill them. If you use the serum on <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> in the Rawhide Saloon, the patrons will offer startled floats and Merk will turn hostile. You can also use it on <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> if he gets too annoying. <em>Cristian Golumbovici</em> reports that using the serum on Frank Horrigan at the end of the game does nothing. Then again he's not your average super mutant (and more specifically, he doesn't have the correct kill type).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you use the serum on a super mutant in combat mode, you get the 1000 xp and complete the quest but the mutant will take one or a few turns before dying. If you kill it before then and loot the corpse the Mutagenic Serum may still be there. This way you can use the serum on, for instance, Grundel in the Military Base and still get combat xp for killing him. Nimrod adds: "If you get into combat with a supermutant, kill him, and have enough AP left over before combat ends, you can use the serum on the dead body and complete the quest. This can be used in the NCR if you fight <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> since the hypo doesn't get taken away when you enter the ring, meaning you can complete the quest quickly without leaving town or needing to kill any friendly super mutants. The only quirk is you don't get the toxic meltdown animation. Using it on him in combat got me stuck in the ring. However using it on him after he's dead but before the combat ends doesn't get you stuck." The Masticator warns: "When fighting <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> the super mutant, if you use the anti-mutant syringe before you damage him in combat he will fall on the floor and he is counted as alive, but unable to move. This traps you in unending combat mode. However, if you damage him at least once before using the syringe he dies normally."Using the serum on him while he's still alive will make Merk hostile, though (assuming you kill <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> before the serum takes effect, so that you don't get stuck). As far as I know, other mutants don't cause this bad freeze-up.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you talk to Cyberdog after reporting back, you can ask Dr Henry about cyber-genetics again and get the whole quest all over again. Another bug is that if you turn him down after he describes his work, asking him again will eject you from dialogue. Saving and loading the game fixes this.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-ncr5"> <span>Deliver Westin's holodisk to Lynette in Vault City.</span></summary><p>When you deliver Bishop's Holodisk to Westin he'll ask if you're a Vault City citizen, and if you are he gives you this quest. (If you have the quest to kill Westin you can do it before you leave, since there's no additional reward once you deliver his disk.) For a successful delivery you get 1500 xp, a H&K G11 and 2 Frag Grenades, which Randal in Vault City will supply.</p><aside class="green"><p>If Lynette thinks highly enough of you when you deliver the holodisk, she'll make you Captain of the Guard, a position which has several advantages as decribed in the Vault City section. To pull this off you need CH 8 and getting Lynette's "respect counter" high enough by adressing her as First Citizen at every turn. The easiest way to do this requires Speech 75% and being a citizen (which you obviously are since Westin gave you his disk), and can be done right before giving the disk to Lynette.

She'll then give you this quest. The other way is to get Merk's quest to kill the Hubologist and tell her, but say you won't do it. Although the dialogue ends at this point, you'll get the letter in your inventory and the quest in your Pip-Boy. Delivering the report yields 500 meagre xp with no additional reward from either AHS-9 or the Hubologist in NCR. Hmpf.

When the Hubologist is dead you earn 2000 xp and can return to Merk for his next task. You get these xp even if you don't talk to Merk first.</p><aside class="blue"><p>Now for a quick lesson in how to kill silently for fun and amusement. Basically there are three ways to do this: 1) Feed your victim a number of Super Stimpaks in quick succession (put one in an active item slot and use them from there for convenience). Each one does 9 damage, so you should have the Awareness perk and divide the HP of your intended victim by that number, rounding up. Wait 10 minutes using the Pip-Boy, and voilá. 2) Set an explosive to go off and plant it on your victim using Steal, or drop it one or two hexes away while sneaking (darkness helps). If your target doesn't die from the blast you'll enter combat mode which is usually bad, and the same happens if another critter is harmed by the blast. However, you can circumvent these effects by running far away from anyone who's allied with the victim before the bomb goes off. If you can survive the blast you can even keep the explosives in your own inventory and stand next to the victim. A clever variation of this is the concept of "satchel charges", as described by Corpse: "I found a cool way to assassinate people with explosives. If you have the Bag you find in the Modoc mole rat lair, just place the explosives in it, set the timer (while they are in the Bag), then drop the Bag with the explosives next to your victim and run. Kaboom! You could even do that when they are with a large group of goons and no one will notice. This also works if you place the explosives in any container (a locker or a desk etc.) near your victim." If you're setting more than one bomb at once, make sure there's a wall or something behind the victim so they don't get thrown back by the first blast and avoid the others. 3) Enter Sneak mode and dispatch your victim in normal combat, but you only have one round in which to do it. It doesn't matter if you use a "loud" weapon and most often it doesn't matter if there are people around. You'll probably have to hit end turn once before being able to end combat, but if you've played the game up until this point you may already know it often works that way.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>If you kill someone using Dynamite, crashes may occur. Just try again and eventually it should work (or if not, well, switch to another method). People have also reported crashes when using the Pip-Boy to wait for Dynamite to explode, or leaving the current map (which forces explosives to go off), but it's my belief that these things do not in themselves cause the crashes. Also, as noted previously in the guide, it's not a good idea to save while there are explosives waiting to go off.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>It is not recommended that you run off a map while waiting for explosives to kill someone. Although they will take damage and die as appropriate, any code related to their death (like setting death variables or moving shop inventories) will not be executed, which could halt quests in their tracks or cause other problems. For instance, in the case of the Enlightened One, you wouldn't get the 2000 xp and Merk would never consider the task to be completed.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>Running off the map while waiting for someone to die of a Super Stimpak overdose is also likely to crash the game. This will not happen for all nameless characters like NCR townspeople, but you can be sure that it happens with any critter that needs to set variables or do other things upon dying (and the Enlightened One is one of them). There is normally no reason to do this anyway.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>In some areas killing certain people will make others hostile even if you manage a "silent" kill (e.g., Torr in downtown Klamath, AHS-9 or Westin if you do the Sneak-kill). You may not be attacked right away, but attempts to communicate or walk around openly are likely to end badly. This is because some death scripts set variables and so on regardless of how that death came about. Death by Dynamite or Super Stimpak should only have this effect in very rare cases, though.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-ncr10"> <span>Stop brahmin raids.</span></summary><p>Go to Westin's ranch and talk to Felix.

Talk to Felix again and you're teleported to the pastures. Wait a while... and two talking deathclaws appear and depart.

Go there and follow them to their lair... Vault 13! There's actually a small glitch you can exploit here, but not to any great use. Even if the rocks aren't removed to reveal the new exit, you can click one of the hexes at the top that are half offscreen, and your character will run off the screen further down and onto the exit grid! You then get to go to Vault 13; however, it doesn't actually appear on your world map.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you should leave the pastures by either exit grid before the deathclaws appear, or if you refuse to follow Felix to the pastures in the first place, you can't end the quest.

She'll put Vault 15 on your world map, of course, and give you infinite holodisks if you ask her about NCR. If you want to you can go to Deputy Karl and ask to see the prisoner.

To secure access to the vault you must have killed Darion and talked to Zeke about letting NCR annex the Squat, in which case you don't need the parts. Or else you could just walk into the vault, take the parts and return with those without dealing with Darion. Tandi sends you to Gunther who will reward you with 5000 xp and $6000 no matter if you killed Darion, got the parts, or both.

However, if you killed Gruthar, or if you visited Vault 13 after the Enclave killed the deathclaws, you can tell her it's free for the taking, and you will then gain a bonus when collecting the reward from Gunther. If you ask for $20,000 you will get that in addition to your normal monetary reward, otherwise the bonus will be "only" $10,000.

The caravan master shows up outside the gate to Westin's estate around 8 a.m. next morning and waits there for 6 hours, although he won't disappear as long as you stay on this map. You should save your game before talking to the caravan leader, and keep that slot intact until you're done with this quest, because like all caravan jobs it's buggy as hell. On your way to Redding you'll face 1-4 random encounters of extremely varying difficulty (see Redding for caravan behaviour). Upon arrival you earn cash depending on how many brahmin survived: $0 (0), $1000 (1-3), $2000 (4-5) or $3000 (6-10), but no quest xp. Since you actually walk all the way from NCR to Redding this quest will take a while in game time (more than 2 months walking back and forth). If you have the <a href="#car">Car</a> you don't get to bring it. Of course, you could take your chances with another caravan... If you ask Duppo about work after this quest, he'll tell you to come back in a few months, but this dialogue never changes no matter how long you wait.</p><aside class="green"><p>This caravan job differs from the usual ones in a few ways. Firstly, Hal won't give the all-clear signal out loud, so you'll have to use your own judgement (remember that mobsters must be killed). Secondly, you <em>can</em> abandon this caravan - or even kill everyone in it! - and still go to Redding and pick up your reward (always $1000 in this case, unless all the brahmin died before you left the caravan).

I guess Zeke's house is supposed to be the shack with the manhole in it, but where did that cliff face come from?</p><p>When you first get here, people won't be very talkative. Zeke won't talk to you, Dalia guarding the path to the northeast won't let you pass, so your only choice is talking to Rebecca, the woman standing south of the tent in the middle.

If you kill one squatter the others won't turn hostile.</p></aside><p>To enter the vault, use Zeke's keycard on the metal door in the cliff. If you try to open the door without it, you'll take 10-20 damage; with a ludicrously high Lockpick skill (250%, no lockpick item will work) you can actually pick the door, but you'll still take damage every time you open or close it (unless your Traps skill is also in the same range, which will prevent you from getting hurt but also from opening the door). Once inside, simply don't talk to any of the guards and you don't have to fight them. If you're addressed by the woman in front of the elevator as you come down, you can tell her your name is Pat if your IN and Speech are up to it and they'll think you're one of them, else you have to fight them (this turns the Khans on levels 2 and 3 hostile as well).</p><p>The doctor on level 1 will heal you for free (HP, poison and radiation, no NPCs), but won't talk to you at all if you've killed any of the squatters. He'll give you some pointless info on Darion. You can't tell him he's free to leave even if you kill Darion's people. The computer terminal on the wall by the forcefield emitter will turn the forcefield on or off once you restore power. The ladder at the bottom of this map should theoretically go to the manhole in Zeke's house, but since that's inaccessible until you seal the deal with NCR you end up outside instead. Error, does not compute.</p><p>Whatever you do on level 2, don't miss the Combat Armor in the footlocker (and the .223 Pistol isn't so bad, either). Use first Science and then Repair on the generator to bring power back online for 3000 xp. This has the effect of starting up the forcefield by the entrance on level 1. If you anticipate some trouble fighting the raiders I recommend that you start the battle on this level, because you can then avoid the vulnerable starting position in front of the elevator.</p><aside class="green"><p>The forcefield can be temporarily disabled using Repair on the emitter as usual. Using explosives is a more expensive and also less reliable way; most likely the first Dynamite will only make the field flicker for a few seconds, but the second should take it out. If you try using Lockpick, Science or Repair on the forcefield itself, you end up taking 10-15 points of damage.</p></aside><p>On level 3, the leftmost working computer contains the location of Vault 13 if you pass a Science check. The "middle" one is used to turn the entrance forcefield on or off (IN&lt;4 characters can use this one but not the one on level 1). Actually you should turn it off since it'll get damn annoying during the fight on your way out if you didn't already kill the Khans on level 1. One of the lockers holds the computer parts Tandi was talking about, but if you're going to fight Darion you don't need them.</p><aside class="green"><p>On level 3 you find the anomalous HK P90c which is initially loaded with 9mm ammo (but can only be reloaded with 10mm). It's been theorized that this weapon was originally meant to use this calibre, but that it was changed either inadvertently or because of the scarcity of 9mm ammo. Some robbers in caves with HK P90c's also carry 9mm ammo, although their guns are loaded with 10mm ammo.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="vault-15--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#vault-15--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-v151"> <span>Give Spy Holodisk to authority in NCR.</span></summary><p>The computer in Darion's room will give you a Spy Holodisk if you pass a Science check.

If you're evil, i.e. have karma -1 or lower or are a Childkiller or Berserker, Gruthar casts Detect Evil and won't let you inside the vault.

Usually you can then reply in an admiring, neutral or spiteful manner. Most often it doesn't matter which response you choose, but there are some critters you can talk into attacking if you're rude and/or aggressive enough.

If you do, you're teleported to level 1 where the guard attacks Matt. If you do nothing, Matt will be massacred and that's it, but Gruthar will turn hostile if you tell him "Screw you and everyone who looks like you" (or the stupid equivalent, which is not obviously offensive). If you help Matt escape by killing Thearn and Gruthar, he just runs away and disappears without so much as a thank you, and you get no extra xp or anything. After you examine the computer you can provoke Matt into attacking you, or you could even execute him in cold blood with no consequences.</p><aside class="green"><p>If Matt dies but Gruthar remains alive, the game will crash if you leave the vault and return, or if you save and load in the vault.

You can move freely between the three levels and finish what business you have, but don't bring about Matt's demise unless you're killing the deathclaws or you don't plan to return to Vault 13 until after the massacre.</p></aside><p>On level 3 you can pick the lockers and take the stuff, including a G.E.C.K. (remember your Arroyo quest?) and the important Navcom Parts, and no one will notice or care.</p><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="vault-13--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#vault-13--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-v131"> <span>Fix the Vault 13 computer.</span></summary><p>The computer is in the Overseer's room on level 3. Looking inside it will lead you to discover the problem. Get a Computer Voice Module and use it on the terminal (or just access the terminal with the module in your inventory) to fix it. If you ask Jimmy about where to get one he will in a clairvoyant fashion point you in the direction of Vault City and New Reno. Talk to Gruthar afterwards for 5000 xp, and if you didn't already take the G.E.C.K. he'll hand it to you.</p><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: Gruthar won't hand you the G.E.C.K., so you'll have to help yourself. I'm sure that kind of thing comes quite naturally by now.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Two weeks after you get the 5000 xp from Gruthar, Frank Horrigan and his Enclave goons will arrive to butcher the deathclaws (unless you're there, of course, in which case they just wait until you've left). Everyone dies but <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, and you can use the computer to see a video sequence of what happened. In order to keep the deathclaws alive to the end of the game, don't collect the reward (see the Endings section for more on this). Killing Gruthar stops the massacre from happening, but then you'll get the bad ending anyway. A little weirdly, it's perfectly possible to trigger the massacre after you've been to the Enclave and killed Horrigan.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Mark Furmage adds: "When you watch the killing of Gruthar the pack leader in the 'hologram' the game actually generates the people in the hall, so if you're in dire need of thrills and have a lot of explosives you can kill Gruthar and the Enclave patrolmen. Watch out for Horrigan as he seems to be able to hit your character through Gruthar's still living body... or dead body if you throw some explosives near him. The bodies disappear when the hologram finishes, you get the xp however." Only one charge will go off at a time, so it's very difficult to kill any of the Enclave soldiers. Having NPCs around helps, as they will be visible and may end up attacking the soldiers or even your invisible self. Sebastian Cassten even managed to kill Horrigan using an elaborate scheme that I'll just sum up briefly. Get a number of NPCs with the capacity to deal lots of damage (like <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> with a Vindicator Minigun and plenty of ammunition). Then give them ridiculous amounts of AP (you can get them to 99) using a vast supply of Jet and the save/load trick (see Items) - but do it quickly, since the duration is only five minutes. Place an NPC (<a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> might be suitable for this) in the doorway from the corridor so that the rest won't follow you when you go to activate the recording. Finally, you can tell some or all of your people to attack "the strongest" to make them focus on getting Horrigan. Hopefully your explosives should result in enough combat rounds for them to get the job done with their artificially increased number of attacks.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-v132"> <span>Talk to Goris.</span></summary><p>Gruthar can give you this "quest" by telling you <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> has more knowledge in certain matters. You complete the quest simply by entering dialogue with <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>. After you've asked him a lot of stuff (he puts the Military Base on your map when you ask him what he knows about the Enclave) you can ask him to join your party. Beware that if you leave conversation before you've asked him everything you can, afterwards you'll only be able to ask him to join you (unless for some reason he won't, in which case you get another shot at the questions).</p></details></details></article><hr><article><h2 id="military-base">Military Base <a class="header-link" href="#military-base">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/military-base-704e9c7f.jpg"></picture><blockquote><p>I hope dad comes back soon. I miss his magic tricks.</p><footer><cite>Melchior Jr.</cite></footer></blockquote><p><a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> is the only one who can highlight this on your world map, though Chris in Navarro and Jimmy in Vault 13 both mention its existence. However, although it's a base it's got a large circle on the world map meaning it's always there.</p><p>When you get here, loot everything in the tents. The wolves will run around howling for a while, then attack. Poor misguided wolfies.</p><p>The entrance to the base is blocked, and planting Dynamite by the rocks does nothing... but never fear, the game practically tells you how to solve this little puzzle through hints and messages. To clear the entrance, first pick up the Metal Pole from the sidewalk. Use it on the cart to attach it. Get a Dynamite from the shack to the north and use it on the pole (no need to arm it first). Then push the cart (ST check needed, try until you succeed) and boom, you get 5000 xp for removing those rocks.</p><aside class="red"><p>If you stick an armed Dynamite on the pole, it will look like it's duplicated - on the pole and on the ground at the same time - but this is just the game's way of remembering that the Dynamite on the pole was armed, so that it can be removed if it should go off before you push the cart. Um, never mind.</p></aside><p>Inside, shoot the rats (they're of the variety that radiates you) and loot the bodies (as in the SAD, the holodisks tell a story but aren't used for anything). To the north there's a mutant named Grundel who's hunting for rats and turning his back. If you want to test the Mutagenic Serum without wasting an innocent mutant in Broken Hills, here's a good opportunity. Just walk up behind Grundel and use the serum on him. Slooorrp. Use Repair (at least 50% needed, you can use a Tool) on the generator to get the lights and elevator working for 1500 xp, and remember that the blue boxes can be searched.</p><p>On level 2 it's time to kick some righteous butt, something this game doesn't often encourage you to do. The two mutants in the room to the far right can sometimes be taken out without alerting the others, but the two large groups will notice if you attack either. One possibility is to go to the narrow passage to the room with the bunk beds, shoot a mutant from there and pick them off as they come running. Problem is that your party members might run forward and get themselves killed, but that's what combat settings are for. I find the Bozar works wonders in these close quarters. Or take them out using your favorite tactics, shooting them in the eyes with a Sniper Rifle or whatever, I don't really care. The award for most significant loot on this level goes to the suit of Power Armor in the locker room.</p><p>On level 3 there are some mutants and rats. Most significant loot is the Green Memory Module in the locker. I find this fight a lot harder than the one on level 2, because there are fiends with Laser and Plasma Rifles who can score mean critical hits. Try not to let them swarm you, retreat behind corners with leftover AP.</p><aside class="red"><p>If you walk into the room with the locker and scroll the screen to the right, you'll see two super duper mutants talking about how to prepare a "rat surprise".</p></aside><p>On level 4 there's no one but a lone mutant standing in the radioactive goo that used to be inside the fabled vats (stepping in it will hurt you). Only this is no ordinary mutant, but Melchior Sr. the stage magician, whose small furry creatures have mutated into somewhat more formidable shapes! When you come near he'll blurt something which goes too fast to read (about him being a great magician), and you have no option but to fight him. (Well, theoretically you could yelp like a scared bunny and turn the hell back, but...) Every turn he'll summon up some monsters to help him: first four powerful deathclaws, two at a time, then four fire geckos (who can breathe devastating fire twice each turn), one at a time, then four floaters, one at a time, then six mutated mole rats, one at a time. If you kill all the pets before finishing Melchior (tell your party members to attack "Whomever is closest"), you get 14,315 xp from this battle. Once you kill him and whatever remaining pets, you can get a Gauss Pistol from the ammo crate. You've now officially conquered the Military Base, which means...</p><aside class="red"><p>All your base are belong to us.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Pennyliu123 found a strategy for this fight which requires you to have one or more NPCs. Make sure they follow you past the bottleneck at the entrance to Melchior's room. Once he turns hostile, you can run back just behind the wooden support; with any luck one of your NPCs will move to block the passage. Melchior's pets, unable to reach you, will gather around him instead, so that you and (at times) your NPCs can shoot at them freely. You should definitely save first as there may be crashes.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can get items from fire geckos the same way you get items from rocketbots (see the SAD section). Bodies you can use for the purpose include Melchior, NPCs (dead or unconscious), and unfortunate Enclave soldiers near the elevator. Normally a fire gecko corpse contains a Golden Gecko Pelt, which is hardly worth the extra effort. If killed with a 0-damage critical to the eyes, however, they will instead leave their Flame Breath behind. This is a kind of flamethrower which looks like a big rifle but uses the Small Guns skill and which cannot be reloaded. You can also get these items in random encounters (using NPCs) or at the Toxic waste dump (using NPCs or other geckos). An alternative way of getting the Flame Breath is to knock a gecko unconscious on a hex where there is already a lootable corpse present, but this requires a bit of luck and they may end up using all their "ammo" while you're waiting for them to stop in the right spot.</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="san-francisco">San Francisco <a class="header-link" href="#san-francisco">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/san-francisco-8c2936a0.jpg"></picture><blockquote><p>What sort of stupid questions?</p><p>Oh, like: 'Why can't I use a sword or a chainsaw on my monitor?'</p><footer><cite>The Chosen One and Dave Handy</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Using the Survey Map from the Military Base is the only way to find San Francisco, other than just going here, of course. This is actually a neat place, because you'll find two of the most worthwhile shops in game here, the Flying Dragon 8, which is a kind of general store which also carries some weapons and armor, and the Red 888 Guns, which carries guns, armor and ammo. From the latter you'll want to grab the Gauss Rifle right away, and both shops will have Power Armors for sale (if not right away then after a little while has passed). You can also buy handbooks and Stimpak ingredients, and this is the only place you find Tesla Armors, although myself I've never used one of those. Each of the stores has two tables with different stuff on them. Lao Chou in the Flying Dragon 8 can also give you surprisingly accurate information on where to find the Tanker Fob and NavCom Parts once you get those quests.</p><aside class="green"><p>The first time you come here, if you walk towards the village square you'll see two people in a fighting ring, who exchange a few blows and then disappear. Those are the martial arts dudes of this town. Beware that once you've triggered the scripted sequence, you mustn't leave the map before they've left the ring (this is possible if you run towards the exit as soon as they begin), or Lo Pan will be stuck inside (see Addenda for a bug note on how wrong this can get).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Don't bother searching any of the containers, they're all empty including the lockers. It makes me think this place was designed by the same people that made Broken Hills. In fact all containers in <em>all</em> SF areas are empty, with a few easily enumerated exceptions: the two lockers in the Brotherhood building, and the lockers and footlockers and one bookcase in the Hubologist base.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you worry about paying for expensive Power Armors that you may not need later, you can use this formula. Take the number of party members that can wear armor (<a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>, <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>, <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a>, <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a>/<a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a>), add yourself, deduct three (the number of "free" Power Armors found on the mainland), and add one if you plan to finish Dr Jing's quest later on. Now you have the number of suits you need to buy from the stores.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The left table in the Red 888 Guns store restocks money which does not go into the shopkeeper's inventory until you access that table (most often you'll be buying ammo off the other one). Unlike most shops the money restocks separately on the respective shop owners, $2000-5000 every one to three weeks. If you have traded them more cash than that it won't disappear, but neither will they get more.</p></aside><p>Dr Fung will provide healing (HP and crippled limbs except for eye damage, charging from $100 to $600, no NPCs), sell you Stimpaks (restocking every 1-7 days) and perform implant surgery (which requires knowledge of the VC schematics and using up a Combat Armor for each):</p><dl><dt>Dermal Impact Armor</dt><dd>$5500, 2 days.</dd><dt>Dermal Impact Asslt.

These two bugs happen for the same reason: while the other two doctors remove the "basic" perk when they give you the "enhanced" perk, Dr Fung leaves the basic perk in place, which apparently causes the game to ignore the effects of the advanced one. When you arrive with an advanced upgrade given to you by another doctor, Dr Fung sees only that you don't have the basic one and tries to give you that - with the result that the game will disregard the advanced one you already had, effectively lowering your DR. "Painless" Doc Johnson is cheaper anyway, so always go there.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you ask Dr Fung to trade after he refuses to heal you because you cannot pay, you'll get stuck on an empty barter screen.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The first time you talk to Dr Fung he'll offer you free healing whether you need it or not, after that you won't be able to talk to him (but you can barter with him if you want).</p></aside><p>The house with the garden is the Dragon's place. He'll train characters of good alignment (karma 250 or more) for +5% Unarmed each day, a maximum of four times or until you reach 100%. See quests 12 and 13 for more details, but don't challenge any of the martial arts guys to mortal combat until you've taken both their tests for the xp, and don't take the test until you've got all the training (because afterwards you can't). The Dragon will stop talking to you if you say evil things, so don't do that.</p><aside class="green"><p>Remember that if you're wearing Power Armor, it raises your ST and thereby your Unarmed, so removing it may help things. You can also lower your ST and AG using the after-effects of Buffout if your Unarmed is hovering above 99%.</p></aside><p>The house across the street to the west is where Lo Pan hangs out, the guy who brings a gun into the ring for backup. He'll give characters of evil alignment (karma -250 or less) exactly the same kind of training as the Dragon. If you're not that evil, don't ask him for training or he won't talk to you any more. Instead challenge him to a test of skills - see <a href="#quest-sf13">The Dragon wants you to take out Lo Pan - hand to hand</a></p><aside class="green"><p>You can get training from both Lo Pan and the Dragon, assuming your karma changes by 500 or so in between. Hmm, fat chance.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Beware of bugs while fighting. If you end combat after killing your opponent but before you get the "You win" sign you'll be trapped inside the ring, in which case you must reload immediately since there's no way to get out. To be safe, stick to end turn at all times. It can also happen - when fighting the Dragon's people, at least - that you start winning fights automatically in the first round, but that all fighters remain in the ring and beat you up between fights! <em>Sébastien Caisse</em> comments: "You've probably noticed that in fights, when you get the 'You win' message, you have an extra round, often used by some people to kill the opponent - making bugs appear. However this round was actually provided to save your game. The only 100% 'glitchless' way is to not kill anyone." Depending on your fighting skills, perks and damage you may have to try hard not to do that. I've actually managed to kill every single fighter without any bugs appearing.</p></aside><p>Once you have access to the Brotherhood bunker, go down there and grab the good stuff in the lockers, including two rare pulse weapons and the one-of-a-kind Brotherhood Armor (although that should be worthless to you by now). The medical computer can raise your ST, PE, IN and CH by one if you have the corresponding Memory Modules (red, green, yellow and blue respectively). This will take a few weeks for each, so go check the stores in between each operation. ACE also heals HP, poison, radiation and crippled limbs (except for eye damage) for free, but not NPCs.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you begin the game having CH 10 but not the Gifted trait, you won't be able to use ACE's Charisma increase to offset the penalty of a dermal implant. You can go through with the operation but it won't do anything.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You gain skill points based on your Intelligence when you first enter the character screen after leveling up. Thus if you don't view your character sheet at all for a few levels (but not more than three, or you'll miss a perk!) before raising your IN, you'll get skill points based retroactively on your new IN. This should also work with the Hubologist IN rise, but obviously not the Gain Intelligence perk.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 asking ACE to cure you of radiation would <em>add</em> an amount of radiation equal to your current radiation level.</p></aside><p>If you go northwest from downtown SF, you enter the docks section. There's nothing to do on this map, go directly north to the tanker. In here you'll find two not-so-worthwhile shops (the "gun" merchant has the Jet Antidote for Redding if you couldn't get it from Dr Troy, but only restocks every 1 or 2 weeks) and a few quests to be done before you can sail away into the sunset. The bar is always closed (because the script contains a condition which is always true). Marc beside the bar can answer a few questions. The captain upstairs won't talk to you until you finish <a href="#quest-sf11">The tanker needs fuel</a> or <a href="#quest-sf1">Steal the vertibird plans from the Hubologists</a>, but once you do he'll give you <a href="#quest-sf2">The navigation computer needs the NavComp part to work</a>, <a href="#quest-sf3">You need to use a FOB to access the navigation computer</a> and <a href="#quest-sf10">The Shi need plans for a vertibird from Navarro</a> (or <a href="#quest-sf1">Steal the vertibird plans from the Hubologists</a>, <a href="#quest-sf2">The navigation computer needs the NavComp part to work</a> and <a href="#quest-sf10">The Shi need plans for a vertibird from Navarro</a> depending on which "steal" quest you choose... in any case, those are the NavCom, Fob and fuel quests he gives you), all of which must be completed for the tanker to take off. The computer nearby will tell you what still needs to be done (and will in fact put the NavCom and fuel quests on your list), and you also use this computer to sail off once everything's taken care of.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you kill any of the named vagrants and Sneak over to Badger (so he doesn't get to enter combat mode) and talk to him, he'll say he turned the Shi and the Hubologists against you through his computer. The Shi will turn hostile, but not the Hubologists. Well, that's pretty useless.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>One of the black-haired female vagrants has a rare XL70E3, but you'd have to kill her for it (Super Stimpaks will do, if you don't plan to wipe out everyone here). The other one has a Gauss Rifle, as does Marc. Several of the other punks walk around with H&K G11s that you can steal if you are so inclined. At this point in the game money and extra weaponry should mean very little to you.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Once you set sail you won't be able to return to the mainland before finishing the game, so you should decide what NPCs, items and weaponry you should bring. Strictly speaking you don't need to bring anything at all, but if your character doesn't have a high IN and/or Speech, you may want to bring plenty of ammo and some devastating weaponry.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>A player who calls himself Mikes_29 has made the point that if you plan on leveling up on random encounters in the wasteland, you should do it before the Enclave. This way you have something to look forward to, whereas playing when there is nothing left to do will most likely feel significantly less rewarding (and then you'll be able to get any number of free xp by other means). One argument for making no xp runs at all before taking on the Enclave is that this way of boosting your character makes it mostly irrelevant how well you performed during the earlier stages of the game. But this is all up to you, of course.</p></aside><p>Now there are two factions in San Francisco except for the Brotherhood, namely the Shi, who make up the bulk of the population, and the Hubologists, who form a crazy evil sect with an uncanny resemblance to... something. The leaders of the former reside in the Steel Palace to the east of the downtown map, while the others are holed up beneath what appears to be the remains of one end of the Golden Gate bridge, to the northeast of Chinatown.</p><p>In the Steel Palace, you'll find three different types of computer terminal (aside from the usual generic ones which cannot be used): the chemistry workstations (the room to the left when you come in, and the three along the wall in the room to the right), the physics workstations (the ones inside the railing in the room to the right) and the biology workstations (some of the terminals in the room to the north past the throne room). When you first arrive here only the chemistry terminals can be accessed; the other two, which you have no real use for anyway, must be activated from the mainframe. (Don't mind the "incredible luck" message you get when trying to access the biology workstations, it's a scripting error.) You don't actually need a good Science skill to hack into a workstation, all that happens is that the lab techs' floating text changes.</p><p>If you proceed through the throne room and use Repair on the forcefield emitter (nothing happens if you fail), you can try to hack into the Shi mainframe. With good Science you can do this for 3000 xp, but after you log off the guards will have noticed and everyone will be hostile, including the people in Chinatown. Bad. If you have Science at least 115%, however, you can hack into the computer without anyone ever noticing, and then you get 7000 xp instead. Good. From here you can activate the workstations and access them, as well as read some trivia and format the hard drive (not your own - the one in the game). If Ken Lee gave you the password you don't get any xp from using it to access the computer, but you can still hack your way in for the xp (the Shi <em>will</em> turn hostile if you do a poor job of it, though). Of course, failing a hacking attempt completely turns everyone hostile as well.</p><aside class="green"><p>Apart from doing <a href="#quest-sf8">Kill Badger so the tanker vagrants will embrace the Hub</a>, you can get the password from Ken Lee by asking for fuel if you have the tanker fuel quest active (you get one chance) and pass a difficult Speech check. You can still get the quests from him afterwards.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>I think the only thing you can do at a workstation that you can't do from the mainframe is read a personnel file in the biology database, which is not important. However, one big difference is that from the chemistry workstations you can divert fuel to the tanker <em>and</em> the space shuttle, if you have both those quest, while the mainframe will realize after you move the fuel to one place that there isn't any left. This is a bug.</p></aside><p>Over at the Hubologist base, talk to Dave Handy outside, ask him where he's from and why he's come here to find out he's got a crush on Vikki Goldmann downstairs. After you mention this to Vikki, return to Dave and tell him what she said. If you say she made fun of him, you get a one-shot chance to tell him to get back at her by doing quest-related stuff. If you tell him she thinks he's hot you can leave conversation and return later if there's anything you want him to do, but it might mean missing a few xp (see <a href="#quest-sf10">The Shi need plans for a vertibird from Navarro</a>).</p><aside class="green"><p>Asking him to format the Hubologist hard drive (Speech check needed) for 0 xp has two minor effects: firstly you gain 25 karma, and secondly AHS-9 will not give you <a href="#quest-sf4">Kill the Shi emperor</a> if you ask him for work (but AHS-7 will). If you mock Dave afterwards, he attacks. Apart from that no one cares. Additionally, Misha found that if you told Dave that Vikki likes him you can have him do this as many times as you like and obtain the karma bonus each time. If you don't mind exploiting a bug this is probably the easiest way of quickly raising your karma by a large amount.</p></aside><aside class="rp"><p>A couple of more things to do with the Hubologist computer</p><p>When you access the Hubologist mainframe, you now have two more options. First, if you got fuel to the Hubologist space ship earlier, instead of getting Dave Handy to redirect it to the tanker, you can now do it yourself from here (5000xp). Very useful in case Dave Handy or Badger won't cooperate with you or if you have killed them etc.</p><p>The second thing you can do is to reformat the whole system for 100 xp. You will have to hack it first, 100% is needed for that. Of course this is not wise to do before you are absolutely sure you have done everything you want with the Hubologists. They will go hostile.</p></aside><p>In my opinion, the Hubologists are in their own way far more despicable and dangerous than either New Reno or Vault City, though some may disagree. Still, they give quests, so they must be obeyed (we can always kill them later). To become a Hubologist you first need to get inside the base, in any of these simple ways:</p><ul><li>Tell the AHS-7 you have a letter for the AHS-9, if you have the quest from NCR.</li><li>Tell the AHS-7 you need to see Crocket, if you've spoken to Lao Chou or Dr Jing about him.</li><li>Tell the AHS-7 you're thinking of joining the Hubologists.</li><li>Use Repair on the forcefield emitters. No one seems to mind.</li><li>With IN&lt;4 the AHS-7 will let you pass if you got the alignment in NCR or if you say you want to get one.</li></ul><p>Find Vikki and Juan to the northeast and listen to their sales pitch, or at least set them off by walking up to them and then go loot the footlockers while they prattle (you can also skip their speech by resting). If you talk to them afterwards and agree to join, you get a holodisk but are not a true Hubologist until you go to speak to the AHS-7 by the stairs. If you didn't get the zeta scan in NCR, you have to subject yourself to one now in order to become a Hubologist. After joining the AHS-7 for a session in the prayer room, either your IN and LK will increase by 1, or your LK will drop by 1. These changes are permanent, so save first. He'll try to give you <a href="#quest-sf7">The Hubologists need fuel for their spaceship</a>, and now you can also talk to Harry outside to get quests. You can get the scan here and still turn down the offer to become a Hubologist, but they won't like you afterwards.</p><aside class="green"><p>Beware another scripted sequence bug: if you leave this map after setting off the speech but before it's finished, Vikki and Juan will remain on the podium, completely unresponsive.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The AHS-9 will give you the same quests and rewards as the AHS-7. It doesn't matter which one of them you report back to.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The whole thing is a bit different for a stupid character. If you got the zeta scan in NCR you can head on in and get <a href="#quest-sf4">Kill the Shi emperor</a> from the AHS-9 only. If you didn't, then you'll get the alignment from Juan and Vikki, not from the AHS-7. Note that if you have IN 3 then the "good" result of this scan will make you unstupid, which is probably not what you want (especially considering the reward for <a href="#quest-sf4">Kill the Shi emperor</a>, see below), so I'd recommend getting the scan in NCR instead.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you become a Hubologist, none of Dr Fung, Lo Pan or the Dragon in Chinatown will talk to you (so you may want to do all quests related to them first). Strangely enough, the Shi will. If you fight the Hubologists you'll be able to talk to these people again (this is a change from v1.0).</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In one of the footlockers you will find a pointless oddity: two lit Flares. Their unlimited duration might have been a good thing, if they had actually emitted light, which they don't, and if anyone had ever used Flares anyway. They can be sold, though.</p></aside><p>Crocket in the room with the Hubologist mainframe will upgrade two suits of Power Armor into Hardened Power Armor for $10,000 each. You can also threaten to kill him if he doesn't do it for free, but he may call your bluff so save first. Or you could just steal your money back. If you get <a href="#quest-sf16">Get some hardened power armor from Crockett</a> you can make him upgrade any number of suits even though he says he's out of chemicals. Accessing the mainframe (good Science needed, try until you succeed) doesn't lead to anything useful at all; it may have been intended for an omitted quest, or just for flavour.</p><aside class="green"><p>There's a slight glitch here: you can pay Crocket to upgrade multiple armors as long as you don't leave dialogue, and lose money (assuming you pay, that is) and one Power Armor each time, but naturally when he's done you only get one back. This would be sort of the opposite of bug exploitation.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you fight the Hubologists you can't talk to Crocket any more (assuming he survives).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The forcefields in the Hubologist and Shi bases can be taken out with Repair or Dynamite without alerting anyone (if you use explosives and fail a Traps roll the field will just flicker for 1-2 minutes). You'll have to do this in order to get out once you start killing people in either place. Bring a Tool if you want to be able to disable the forcefields in combat mode.</p></aside><aside class="rp" id="hubologist-stash"><p>Find the location of the Hubologist stash.</p><p>If you can get in and search the files of the Hubologist mainframe computer, this location will be added to your map. You need science over 80% to have a chance to access the computer, and you can try as many times as you want. You really should have at least 100% though, as that's what is needed to access the finance information, where the location of the hub stash is given.</p><p>When you arrive, a guard will ask you a question to prove you are a Hubologist. If you kill him, you can blow out the door with some dynamite (everyone inside will be hostile).</p><p>There are three different questions he might ask:</p><ol type="a"><li>Who was the founder? = Dick Hubbel.</li><li>The church believes everything is symbolized by? = A turning wheel.</li><li>What is meant by Enlightenment? = A state achieved when the seeker has gained so much knowledge he becomes an integral part of the universe and leaves this earthly existence behind.</li></ol><p>After that he wants to know why you are here. To convince him everything is in order you have to pass a fairly hard speech roll (100% speech = 50 % chance), failing that you get a slightly easier speech roll (80% speech = 50 % chance). Pass and he will let you in, fail and he attacks.</p><p>The treasure is all on the 1st and 3rd floors. On the third floor there is a guard, but you can tell him you are there to take over his shift and he will leave (speech roll, 70-80% should do it). (Talk to the robed guy on floor one so you have his name to bluff the guard with.) You can then loot the room in peace if you want. To open the three safes on the 3rd floor you need lockpick over 100% to have any kind of chance. Electronic lockpicks will reduce the requirement somewhat. Apparently they are explosion proof. (I never join the Hubologists, and since you don't receive any experience for finding this place, killing the guards is good for 350xp each.)</p></aside><p>A note on the quest list below: You cannot be assigned to steal the Vertibird Plans from both the Shi and the Hubologists in the same game, for the simple reason that you must choose one faction to give the plans to in the first place. (This is the only time in <em>Fallout 2</em> where two Pip-Boy quest entries are mutually exclusive; <em>finishing</em> conflicting quests is of course a completely different matter.) If you get as many quests as possible in your quest log (which means you have to become a Hubologist), the Hubologist fuel quest will always be quest number 6. For this reason there are two quests with the number 5 in the list, so that all the quests with higher numbers in your log will match those in this list. If that seems confusing, feel free to ignore the numbers altogether.</p><aside class="rp"><p>There is now a whole new step that needs to be done before you can set off with the tanker and go to the Oil Rig. The old, wrecked submarine that the Shi came with to San Francisco has had its automatic defense mechanism reactivated. That means that any ship moving in the area will be fired upon. Naturally that needs to be taken care of before you set sail with the tanker. If you haven't talked to anyone about this before, you will hear about the sub when you have made the tanker ready and choose the 'go' option on the Poseidon Network computer. It will warn you and won't let you continue.</p><p>None of this applies to dumb characters. I assume Matt from the brotherhood takes care of things together with the fuel and other stuff.</p><p>To reach the sub you need to use the small boat moored on the opposite side of the tanker, but unfortunately it's guarded. There are three ways of getting on the boat, besides killing the guard.</p><p>The Emperor: Log on to the emperor and check history on the submarine to learn more about it. Find out about maintenance crew and add yourself to the roster. Download passwords to your Pip-Boy (1000xp). It's hidden under; Database, History, Submarine status, Stationary Defense structures.</p><p>Lao Chou in Flying Dragon 8: He deals in information, but for him to answer, you need to know what questions to ask. The first one to ask is about your villagers (need to know of your tribes fate from Hakunin or the Emperor, or if you know you need to fix the tanker from the Captain, or if you checked the status on the Poseidon Network computer). To get him to actually talk about the submarine you need to do one of the following: Pass a speech check (91%) or have sex with him (female with CH 7 or the sex appeal trait). You can also pay $2000 or $1500 if you pass a barter roll (65% barter = 50% chance), or if you fail or say that is too much, you can offer some quality time with <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> (if you are married of course). To get the password you will have to pay. $10000 or $5000 with a successful barter roll (75% barter = 50 % chance). There is no way around this. If you already have the password from elsewhere you can no longer talk to him about the sub.</p><p>The boat guard at the docks: If your speech is 96% then you can convince the boat guard to let you use the boat. He'll pretend you give him the password (1000xp). Again, you need to know of the fate of your tribe or that you need to fix the tanker to get this line. If you already have a password, you can't get him to let you have it without one.</p><p>Next to the boat is a depressed dockworker, Meng. You can listen to his sad tale and convince him to move on with his life (speech 81%) for 500xp. Before he goes you can learn a little about the submarine from him, but he can't get you to it.</p><p>There is a way to get the password from all three at the same time, though I'm sure it's a bug. First get it from the boat guard, then Lao Chou, and finally from the Emperor.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="san-francisco--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#san-francisco--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-sf1"> <span>Steal the vertibird plans from the Hubologists.</span></summary><p>You'll get this quest from Ken Lee if you gave the Vertibird Plans to the Hubologists. One way of stealing them is to ask Dave Handy to copy the plans for you when you get him to do stuff for you (you can then drop them and ask for more, but there's no need for that). You get this option even if you don't have the quest active, as long as the Shi have asked you for the plans. Badger can also hack into the Hubologist computer for you if you give him a day or three. Bringing them back to Dr Wong earns you 5000 xp.</p><aside class="green"><p>You can get the quest to retrieve the plans from Navarro and then to steal them if you give the plans to the Hubologists in the meantime.

As you may already know, the Shi Emperor is actually a computer in the room behind the throne (the whole thing is kinda reminiscent of the Dead Nations in <em>Planescape: Torment</em>), and one way of doing this quest is to hack into it and format the hard drive. This isn't exactly a good idea, since all the Shi including those in Chinatown and all the shopkeepers will turn hostile. However, the other way is to kill Ken Lee, which can be done with Super Stimpaks without offending a soul. You get 5000 xp when you return to AHS-7 or AHS-9 with news of your Kirk-like computer-wrecking skills or Stimpak sneakiness, but then the AHS-9 will basically tell you to piss off.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you already got the fuel for the Hubologists you only get one chance to ask AHS-7 for this quest, and you won't be able to report back to him (for that, go to the AHS-9 instead). You can restore this dialogue by moving the fuel on to the tanker.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The AHS-9 will actually have a reward for the stupid character: preparing the tanker just like after the Brotherhood quest (see below). Thus you get 5000 extra xp for getting the fuel (even if you already secured it), and what's more, the thing is bugged so that you can talk to the AHS-9 again for 5000 xp each time.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It's not possible to be rewarded for both assassination quests.

This is worth 5000 xp, and you get <a href="#quest-sf8">Kill Badger so the tanker vagrants will embrace the Hub</a> if you still want to see the Emperor.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you already killed AHS-9, you won't get this quest.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-sf11"> <span>The tanker needs fuel.</span></summary><p>You find out about this quest on the bridge of the tanker, from the computer or from the captain. There are several ways of getting fuel for the tanker, which is worth 5000 xp unless otherwise specified:</p><ul><li>From Dr Jing after doing <a href="#quest-sf16">Get some hardened power armor from Crockett</a>.</li><li>From Badger after doing <a href="#quest-sf11">The tanker needs fuel</a>.</li><li>From a Shi chemistry workstation.</li><li>From the Shi mainframe (a bonus of 3000 xp if you did <em>not</em> yet gain Ken Lee's permission to use the computer).</li><li>From Dave Handy after talking to Vikki (5000 xp if you tell him she made fun of him and he gets the fuel from the Shi, 3000 xp if you tell him she made fun of him and he gets it from the Hubologists, no xp if you tell him she thinks he's hot).</li><li>From Matthew when you complete <a href="#quest-sf1">Get the vertibird plans for the Brotherhood of Steel</a> if you have IN&lt;4.</li><li>From the AHS-9 when you complete <a href="#quest-sf4">Kill the Shi emperor</a> if you have IN&lt;4.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>The last two options don't take fuel from any particular place. Of the others, only Handy can get the fuel if the Hubologists have it (Badger says he can, but see below). Using the workstation is the only way you can get fuel from the Shi after you've already moved it from there.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can get double experience by taking advantage of a glitch: tell Badger to transfer fuel (from the Shi or the Hubologists), then get the fuel in some other way while he's busy hacking, and finally return to collect Badger's xp. Another Badger bug is that if the Hubologists have the fuel and you ask him to get it from there, this triggers the completion of <a href="#quest-sf7">The Hubologists need fuel for their spaceship</a> over again, meaning you get 6000 xp but the fuel doesn't get transferred and this quest is left unresolved. Making use of the first bug makes the second irrelevant.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you let Dave Handy move the fuel from the spaceship to the tanker, this drains the Hubologists' fuel reserves so that you can go to a Shi workstation and use it for another 6000 xp. This is of course possible only because of the workstation bug. Telling Badger to steal the Hubologists' fuel does not have this effect, since he actually doesn't.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If Handy hacks the Shi computer for the fuel it triggers Badger's death sequence (meaning you can't talk to Badger from that point).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Someone expressed interest in how to go about the fuel thing to maximize the xp count. Taking advantage of three glitches this would seem to be: First of all, give the Vertibird Plans to the Hubologists. Go to the Shi mainframe and route the fuel to the Hubologists (9000 xp). Go to Badger and tell him to get the fuel from the Hubologists for the tanker. Go to Dave Handy and pick the "made fun" option, then tell him to move fuel to the tanker (3000 xp) and be sure to get a copy of the plans. Go to the Shi and use a workstation to move fuel to the Hubologists (6000 xp), wait and return to Badger (6000 xp). Finally lower your IN using drugs and get another 5000 xp for fuel when you give the plans to the Brotherhood. In all, 29,000 xp. You could also include the stupid reward for <a href="#quest-sf4">Kill the Shi emperor</a> in this scheme, but that's on the dark path (and yet another glitch). If you don't want to cheat at all I suppose you'd only get 12,000 xp: 9000 from the Shi mainframe and 3000 from Handy.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-sf12"> <span>Find Badger's girlfriend in the hold below the ship.</span></summary><p>Once you get the tanker fuel quest or a quest to steal the Vertibird Plans, you can ask Badger to hack the Shi or Hubologist computer for you, and he will give you this task. You don't need to get it in advance, though. Go into the hold by the manhole in Badger's room or the stairs in the back, kill the monsters and aliens (good, clean fun), and go talk to Suze in the northeast corner. Lead her to one of the two stairs and she'll disappear. When you've followed her up, talk to Badger and you get 5000 xp for your troubles. If Suze is discovered and killed by the monsters (or if you kill her), you get no xp, but Badger will still hack for you after you give him 3 hours to mourn. In any case he'll only perform one hacking job for you (takes him 3 days if Suze is dead, 1 day if she lives), then you won't be able to talk to him again.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you let Badger hack the Shi computer, then the next time you visit the tanker after 1-3 days have passed (the timer starts when you leave and re-enter the tanker), you will see a cutscene in which he is executed by two Shi guards. No big deal since you have no further use for him, and if you have the quest to kill Badger you can now report back to the AHS-7. It all adds up. 🙂</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can liven up the cutscene by dropping explosives in front of the exit (if you want to hit the Shi guards) or halfway between the exit and the barrel (if you want to hit Badger as well). Enter the tanker when the execution is scheduled to happen and set the timer on one or more charges for 20 seconds before scrolling up to trigger the cutscene. Each of the Shi will drop a H&K G11E if they have time to draw them. This won't turn the rest of the Shi hostile, but hurting Badger will turn the punks against you. Depending on circumstances (NPCs, your trap-laying skills) the cutscene may still play to the end, but should Badger die before that, the Shi will remain and you won't return to visibility. In this state you cannot initiate combat nor be attacked (though you can still piss people off), and you can't trigger spatial scripts (mostly meaning you can't use elevators or set off floor traps). The only way to get visible again is to go to NCR and perform Westin's brahmin quest, assuming you still can.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>In v1.0 the Badger cutscene would freeze the game if he was prevented from reaching his destination tile, or (less likely) if you happened to be in combat when it was scheduled to begin.</p></aside></details><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-sf13"> <span>The Dragon wants you to take out Lo Pan - hand to hand.</span></summary><p>Ask the Dragon who he is and whether he'd like to take you on (need Unarmed 125% for this), or challenge him to a test of skills (no skill requirement, oddly enough).

Somewhat annoyingly, when the first explosion goes off you'll most likely be attacked by one of your followers. However, once combat ends and though your PC is invisible, he or she is still able to fulfil all the usual functions (besides attacking that is). Thus I would suggest that before the next blast goes off you should place your character in such a way that it only causes damage to your enemies. Also, when the killing is over you might have some time left to collect a few items. There's a Turbo Plasma Rifle on Matt's body and the containers in the southwestern room are filled with the same loot as in the actual BoS bunker. So there's your second suit of Brotherhood Armor which you'd always been looking for."</p></aside></details><details class="rp"><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-sf18"> <span>Investigate the whereabouts of Dr. Sheng.</span></summary><p>Doctor Sheng is a scientist who has studied sentient plants and done some strange experiments. He is thought to have gone crazy and has left on a sabbatical some time ago. To find him, log onto a Biology station terminal in the northern part of the Steele Palace, and read the recent personnel notes. After that you can ask Dr. Wong about Dr. Sheng and his whereabouts. He will mark the last known location on your Pip-Boy.</p><p>As you enter the abandoned building, you will be greeted by some strange humanoid creatures that wants to bring you to their master, Dr Sheng. He wants you to clear out his laboratory from aggressive plant-creatures for 200xp and $1000. You also get the location of the EPA if you didn't already have it and a second quest. Note that his creatures are pretty tough.</p><p>If you refuse to do any of his quests (or meet with him in the first place), his creatures will attack you.

If you instead convinced the boat guard to let you go without having a password you'll be going there alone (sub is empty). If you kill the boat guard and steal the boat, your NPCs will come with you (this is the only time they do). <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> or <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> can be useful to bring. You get 500xp for reaching the sub.</p><p>When you get there alone or with your NPCs, the hatch will be locked. You can unlock it (lockpick around 50%, keep trying until you are successful) or blow it off with an explosive. Electronic lockpicks does help here.</p><p>Once inside you need to figure out how to disable the defense mechanism. There's several ways, but you can only pick one per game (there's no xp so there would be no point anyway). Oh, and tools, a crowbar or explosives can come in handy here.</p><p>First room: In the upper left corner is an old power console that is in bad shape. It can be destroyed with a crowbar or by using the repair skill (roll, 90% repair = 50 % chance). If you came here with the maintenance crew a technician will be blocking your way. Either kill him or find another way to disable the sub.</p><p>Second room: In the lower right corner you can find the old torpedo target control console. It can be disabled using science (101%) If you came with the crew there is a technician here. Talking to him with speech 81% or science 81% lets you try to trick him into disabling the submarine. You get one try with each skill.</p><p>Torpedo room: You can disable the torpedo propulsion system (repair roll, 100% repair = 50 % chance). You can also use an explosive on it, but don't arm it first. Also you can only use it from your backpack (easy science roll). Watch out for subtech3 if not alone.</p><p>There's also a torpedo arming and loading console here that can be disabled (repair roll, 100% repair = 50 % chance).</p><p>If there is a technician in here, he will talk to you the minute you set foot inside the door. You will need to pass a speech or repair check for him to accept you, depending on what response you give. 70% repair or 70-75% speech should give you a 50% chance. If you fail he won't let you touch anything and will turn hostile if you try a few times. If he accepted you and you want to put explosives on a torpedo, you will have to pass a traps roll. Sneaking while doing it significantly increase your chances.</p><p>Once you have disabled the sub you can leave the sub by using the ladder on the side of the submarine. Back on the docks you gain 1000xp.</p><p>A locker in the torpedo room contains a Command Chart that you can use on the Emperor. Go to Chinese Intelligence Network and you can read some personal logs. This is just for flavor, no experience gained.</p></article><hr><article><h2 id="navarro">Navarro <a class="header-link" href="#navarro">🔗</a></h2><picture><img width="450" height="450" src="https://madcampos.dev/projects/fallout-walkthrough/assets/navarro-d02e84a2.jpg"></picture><blockquote><p>Now I suppose you're going to tell me you're just out looking for a water chip.

The crewmen will find you when you reach the landing pad here and you get the option to jump out and fight or to surrender. If you surrender you will be taken to the base commander for questioning. You can answer some of his questions and ask some yourself but after that he'll try to kill you. Whatever you do there is no way out of it, you will have to fight.</p><p>Note that if you go here unprepared or too early into the game this is pretty much a suicide run. I would recommend being taken to the base commander as you start off alone with him, and you can escape a lot easier from there.</p></aside><p>When you come here you're greeted by a robed guy named Chris who tries to shoo you away. If you accepted the quest from Matthew in San Francisco you can ask him about the Enclave and say you want to join. You get 1500 xp if you pull this off and get the password (you only get one chance). If you bring NPCs he'll complain about your "posse" and you'll have to pass a second Speech check. You can get him to mention both San Francisco and the Military Base, but he won't put any of them on your world map. There are also several dialogue options that lead to him attacking right away, or sounding the alarm then attacking, or leaving you alone. When you're done with him, ask him about vertibirds and mention the Brotherhood; you then get some 20 seconds to kill him before he sounds the alarm (500 xp), which shouldn't be a problem.</p><aside class="green"><p>Due to the NPC bug described below, you will actually need to bring one NPC for Chris to think that you're alone if you have the <a href="#car">Car</a>.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you come in the <a href="#car">Car</a> Chris will open dialogue at once. If you've already been here once that may result in a dialogue where your only choice is to attack and you risk putting the base on alert, so deal with Chris the first time you get here.</p></aside><p>There are three ways you can enter the base. The easiest is to walk into the shack with the trapdoor in the floor (Chris will stop you if he's still alive), and you end up in the underground section. The second is to follow the stony path through the woods to the green exit grid and talk to the guards. If you don't have the password, or if you're not alone, they won't let you pass and attack if you talk to them too many times. You can of course storm the gates and shoot everyone, but this would be what is probably the toughest fight on the mainland and possibly in the whole game, what with those mean turrets.</p><aside class="green"><p>In the woods there are mines which are impossible to spot even with PE 10 and insanely high Traps skill.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can have one NPC along with you and the guards still say you're alone; people you meet will act as if the NPC isn't there. This happens because most Navarro scripts assume that the <a href="#car">Car</a> is included in the "NPC count", which it apparently isn't. Unlike Chris, though, they won't think you're not alone if you actually are. There is one crucial exception: the guard outside the commander's office will raise the alarm if anyone is with you except <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> (you can use Sneak to avoid this), because <em>his</em> script was updated in the patch. Also note that if for some reason you didn't get the <a href="#car">Car</a> from the Den, this bug will not happen.</p></aside><p>Lastly, if you brought the Blue Pass Key from the Gecko power plant, you can enter by the air vent in the southwest corner of the gas station map and unlock the outer cell door. You'll get the 1500 xp for releasing the deathclaw (see <a href="#quest-navarro1">Deal with the deathclaw</a>), and Xarn will walk down the hall (even if you block the doorway) and disappear. If you talk to him he'll act as if he's still imprisoned, so this is probably not supposed to happen. Other than pre-empting the deathclaw quest this doesn't change anything. You can't open the next door from this direction.</p><p>In the underground section, loot the room to the northwest for a suit of Advanced Power Armor, a Blue Memory Module, a Plasma Rifle and stuff. You can talk to the quartermaster in any armor (even the Vault 13 suit) and he just tells you to go get suited up. In the computer room you can hack the computer with good Science, but if you fail the alarm goes off. Or you could ask one of the scientists and if you pass a Speech check he'll tell you the password, "Snookie", after which you can go mock the female guard outside (you can also enter this password after hearing about the nickname from Cookie). Asking the computer about the main base earns you <a href="#quest-navarro3">Retrieve the FOB from the base Commander</a>.</p><aside class="green"><p>With a few exceptions, people in the base won't talk to you if you're not wearing some kind of Power Armor. If you show up inside the base with any NPCs other than <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> (that is, more than one), people will start attacking you.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>The computer mentions that the Enclave main base is accessible by vertibird. Reportedly this was a quest which didn't get implemented (there are quite a few of those). On the other hand the guy in the comm center says the vertibirds are too complex for outsiders to handle. (Obviously he never met this kind of tribal before.)</p></aside><p>On the ground level there are plasma turrets which can make fighting here troublesome. Quincy in the garage to the northeast has the Vertibird Plans in the locker behind him. There are two scientists around, one next door and one in the comm central to the south, who can tell you about the tanker and Vertibird Plans. If you asked any of them about the plans, you can tell Quincy a tech told you to get the plans and he'll let you have them (with very good Sneak you can just pick them up anyway). You get 3500 xp for taking the plans.</p><aside class="green"><p>A sign on the turrets says that tampering with them will lead to death, and in fact using any skill on them makes them attack.</p></aside><p>Taking the lift down from the comm central gets you to a room where nothing much is going on. Save before going to talk to the sergeant south of there. He's a blast! However, you should reload afterwards, because otherwise you'll have the sergeant patrolling the grounds endlessly and attacking if he finds you anywhere except beside the vertibird too many times. He'll also attack if you talk to him repeatedly without some kind of Power Armor on.</p><aside class="green"><p>Don't approach the southern gate from the inside if you didn't give the password to the guards coming from the outside, or they'll attack.</p></aside><p>If you talk to Cookie the cook in the canteen you can get <a href="#quest-navarro3">Retrieve the FOB from the base Commander</a> and some info on what's going on, but it's nothing crucial. In the vertibird hangar you find Raul. If you told Quincy that Raul sent you for the plans, you can tell Raul that Quincy wants to see him, and he walks off to beat Quincy up. If you got the quest to fix <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> you can tell him Dr Schreber sent you to get permission to take the <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a> Motivator from the locker directly behind him. If all else fails, Sneak.</p><p>If you do want to kill everyone, here are a few facts and pointers:</p><ul><li>As long as there are any turrets left on the ground level map, you won't be able to leave combat mode there. Annoying.</li><li>Get the turrets first, and from a distance. They're not so tough to kill, but they do a lot of damage if you allow them to fire.</li><li>Don't let your party spread out. The "stay where you are" combat option comes in handy. From the underground area you can take an elevator to the surface, kill off everyone in the surrounding area, go back down to heal your wounds if you need to, then proceed to the next lift, and so on. This is a whole lot easier than a frontal assault.</li><li>You don't have to kill Cookie.</li><li>If you shun ranged weapons this will be difficult, but by no means impossible. It's vital to keep your party together, so you may want to leave any reckless ones behind (<a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> is impossible here). Sometimes you can sneak right up on the turrets, sometimes not; remember that smashing their sensors turns them into so much scrap metal. Try to lead people around corners and save a lot. This must be why you've been accumulating those insane amounts of Stimpaks and Super Stimpaks.</li><li>Apart from Chris, you don't miss out on any quest xp by attacking from the start.</li></ul><aside class="green"><p>HtH characters can make the underground battle a whole lot easier by taking advantage of a scenery glitch. Once the battle starts, run to one of the vents facing south and stand in front of it (the edge of the hex should touch the wall). It doesn't work for all vents, but the one in the L-shaped corridor going to an elevator should do it, as well as the one in Xarn's room. You'll find the guards can't attack you with ranged weapons and instead just run up to you and stare stupidly. You can't attack them with ranged weapons, either (or even a Super Sledge), but you <em>can</em> hit them with unarmed attacks or melee weapons with range 1. The Hubologist base also has these vents, but this trick doesn't seem to work there.</p></aside><details class="quests" open><summary><h3 id="navarro--quests">Quests <a class="header-link" href="#navarro--quests">🔗</a></h3></summary><details><summary><input type="checkbox" id="quest-navarro1"> <span>Deal with the deathclaw.</span></summary><p>Talk to Dr Schreber in the soundproofed room and ask him about the deathclaw. Whether you offer to kill the deathclaw or not you can now get past the door to the cell. If you kill Xarn, you get 500 quest xp in addition to the 1200 kill xp. Instead you can offer to rescue him, in which case you must have the Blue Pass Key to open the door to the south (1500 xp). If you didn't bring the one from Gecko, there's one in Dr Schreber's desk.

Either Sneak-Lockpick the locker (Sneak 60% and high Lockpick needed), or use (a lot of) Super Stimpaks on the commander.

After a freakin' beautiful cutscene you find yourself on the oil rig that is the Enclave. 15,000 xp are yours for this accomplishment. Exit the first map to the east and you find yourself in a foyer of sorts.</p><p>There's a computer terminal around which you need IN 6 to operate, or IN 4 plus Sneak above 70% (don't ask me why). First of all, see how much information you can get from it by logging on (Science 100% or LK 8) and downloading files to read in your Pip-Boy. With Science 125% you get a report on the reactor computer, telling of what would happen if anyone were to blow it up. Hmm. With Science 150% you can read about a madcap scheme to kill off most of the world's human and mutant population using the FEV virus. Except it's not so madcap because it seems they can pull it off. Lastly with Science 175% you can read a worthless speech draft and a worthless word list. Is that the kind of reward you get for boosting a skill to ridiculous levels?</p><p>Then there are two functions for which you need an item, the Presidential Access Key. Counter insurgence can only be used from this terminal and will be described later. Emergency defensive systems shutdown, which can only be used to any effect on the detention and reactor levels, will make the turrets on the current level snooze for 1-3 minutes. There isn't any major point to this since the turrets will never initiate combat anyway as a result of their level being on alert (seemingly due to some confusion in the scripting of the Enclave alarm system). It will keep the turrets from attacking you for other reasons (see below), but there is no stealth value in this since everyone else will anyway and it won't stop the turrets from firing on you once combat has started. A note of warning: if you try to activate the emergency systems shutdown without the Access Key and have Science 75% or more, the terminal you're using will be permanently deactivated, which is bad especially if it's the one in the foyer. Many of the computers and terminals in the Enclave will bring up the same menu, but they're not very important since you can't do the one truly useful thing from there.</p><aside class="green"><p>You can reach the Access Key options no matter your Science skill, as long as you have the Intelligence to use the computer. If you don't get the option to log on, just choose "Help", "Yes" and "Back to log on" and you'll have the option to log on using the Presidential Access Key.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If your Science level is excessively high, around 200%, you won't cause the terminal to shut down if you try to hack it, but neither will you succeed in your attempt (because the script is incomplete), so you're stuck in dialogue with only one option which loops back to itself. In the rare event that this happens, press 0 (zero) to exit dialogue.</p></aside><p>The turrets in the foyer won't attack unless fired upon, but once you move beyond the foyer, turrets and Enclave denizens will be less forgiving. You can only bring one NPC along without being attacked. You must be wearing some kind of Power Armor, but your NPC doesn't have to. Beware that some security bots are overzealous and will attack if you're not strictly alone. Unless you're going to fight everyone outright, or you desperately need a mule, you should leave your party members in the corridor to the east. Don't leave them on the first map you arrived on, because chances are you won't return there, and don't leave them in the alcove to the south of the foyer, because it will eventually be sealed off.</p><aside class="green"><p>The reason why you can bring one NPC is actually the same bug as in Navarro. The security bots which attack you if you're not alone have been updated in the patch and know they don't have to make allowances for the <a href="#car">Car</a> counting as an NPC. This also means that if you never got the <a href="#car">Car</a> from the Den (fat chance) the bug won't happen.</p></aside><p>If you're bringing your NPCs or if you're just going to kill everyone here anyway, some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>There's no such thing as a general alert status in the Enclave. For each new map you can choose whether to leave your path of violence or grab the good stuff then attack again. Citizens and scientists will never initiate combat, but may fight back if you're in combat mode already (or run away).</li><li>You don't have to fight Curling, Murray or the President (see below), and you can talk to them as if nothing happened even if you fought on those levels. This means you can kill off everyone for xp and equipment and still get the xp of the sneaky/diplomatic path.</li><li>Make use of bottlenecks. Critters that don't see a clear path to you won't move at all, buying you time. Dodge behind doorways and corners a lot. Make them come to you and pick them off as they arrive. Start a fight at the edge of the map, never at the centre.</li><li>Since both you and your opponents will be heavily armored, it's all about criticals here. You should either be using sniping weapons (Gauss Rifle, aimed shot to the eyes or something) or efficient big guns (Avenger or Vindicator Minigun, Bozar). Without the Sniper perk this will be awfully hard, but if you have it, you can clean the place out using a .44 Magnum and plenty of .44 Magnum JHP. With a good HtH weapon and Slayer you should be fine too as long as you avoid open spaces.</li><li>Kill the soldiers with Gauss Rifles first; they're most likely to pierce your armor and score criticals. They're usually the ones wearing "old" power armor. Also look out for the ones with Vindicator Miniguns in the presidential area. Turrets usually won't hurt you - unless they score a critical hit bypassing your armor, in which case you're dead.</li><li>Some of the robots (not the turrets) aren't on the same team as the soldiers as far as the game engine is concerned - these are the ones on the detention level and the two closest to the entrance in the barracks. This means you can ignore them until later, or even take them out first without anyone reacting. If a robot hits an Enclave soldier the soldiers will attack the robots, but when combat ends they will turn on you; this can also lead to the Elder being executed, so watch out.</li><li>As in Navarro, prevent your party from spreading out or running to meet the opposition. This is not least because they'll happily attack some citizen while ignoring the turret next to them which will cut them down in two turns. Chances are they'll be in the way more than anything else, so set their combat options wisely, or just dump them and go solo. <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> will simply die if you bring him here.</li></ul><p>In the barracks area to the east there's nothing to do except search the numerous boxes and lockers and lament the fact that you'll never be able to carry everything you find away from here (unless you're using the barter trick - see the NPC section). There's an Avenger Minigun and plenty of 2mm EC ammo among other things. Also there are a couple of packets of Plastic Explosives in the northeast corner of the map, and you might want to take one for later use. The blast doors to the emergency staircase cannot be opened at this time.</p><p>In the detention area below the foyer you can grab loadsastuff (MVP: Vindicator Minigun) and talk to the Elder and Martin Frobisher in the leftmost cells to either side of the prison corridor. They'll both tell you the same thing: get the G.E.C.K. from the level below if you don't have it, and destroy the reactor computer with explosives (Martin tells you to find it in the barracks if you don't have any).</p><aside class="green"><p>You can actually kill most of the prisoners through the forcefields without any dire consequences. However, if you kill the Elder, you only have until midnight when Hakunin appears and the game ends, same as if you'd attacked the villagers in Arroyo. You can still finish the game before this happens and get the happy end. If you play on, trying to leave San Francisco to the world map will also end the game. One funny thing is that if you stand to the right of the Elder's cell and kill a villager, she'll run through the forcefield and flee down the corridor!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The two eyebots sport Robo Melee Weapons that you can get using the procedure described in the Toxic Caves section. These function as decent punching weapons that require no ammo and deal electrical damage, which is pretty sweet because you can run up to someone, punch them in the eye and then watch them vanish in a violet flash. Just like in real life! Rocketbots in the Enclave carry Avenger Miniguns and/or Robo Rocket Launchers. The two on the presidential level have ordinary Miniguns in addition to the Robo Rocket Launchers; in v1.0 these were not armed at all.</p></aside><p>Below that level is the puzzle room. If it feels like you were just warped into an <em>Eye of the Beholder</em>-type game where you have to put rocks on the right pressure plates to open the door, that's about right. The floor in the square of nine rooms will give off electric charges now and then, damaging you for 2-10 HP (if you have your Advanced Power Armor on); when it does, your character will stop and you have to click on your destination again. Now don't try to open the doors manually or Lockpick them, you'll only take a lot of electrical damage. Instead use the computers to open and close the doors. I'll follow the tradition of presenting the maze like this (you enter from room 2):</p><figure class="map-wrapper"><svg id="enclave-map" viewBox="0 0 810 810" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect x="380" y="20" width="50" height="60"/><rect x="380" y="730" width="50" height="60"/><rect x="620" y="490" width="50" height="70"/><rect x="620" y="250" width="50" height="70"/><rect x="490" y="380" width="70" height="50"/><rect x="730" y="380" width="60" height="50"/><rect x="20" y="380" width="60" height="50"/><rect x="490" y="140" width="70" height="50"/><rect x="490" y="620" width="70" height="50"/><rect x="250" y="380" width="70" height="50"/><rect x="250" y="140" width="70" height="50"/><rect x="250" y="620" width="70" height="50"/><rect x="140" y="490" width="50" height="70"/><rect x="140" y="250" width="50" height="70"/><rect x="380" y="250" width="50" height="70"/><rect x="380" y="490" width="50" height="70"/><rect x="320" y="80" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="320" y="320" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="320" y="560" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="560" y="80" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="560" y="320" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="560" y="560" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="80" y="80" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="80" y="320" width="170" height="170"/><rect x="80" y="560" width="170" height="170"/><text x="20%" y="21%" class="room-text">1</text><text x="20%" y="50%" class="room-text">4</text><text x="20%" y="80%" class="room-text">7</text><text x="50%" y="21%" class="room-text">2</text><text x="50%" y="50%" class="room-text">5</text><text x="50%" y="80%" class="room-text">8</text><text x="80%" y="21%" class="room-text">3</text><text x="80%" y="50%" class="room-text">6</text><text x="65%" y="50%" class="corridor-text">5e</text><text x="65%" y="80%" class="corridor-text">8e</text><text x="50%" y="94%" class="corridor-text">8s</text><text x="35%" y="50%" class="corridor-text">4e</text><text x="35%" y="80%" class="corridor-text">7e</text><text x="6%" y="50%" class="corridor-text">4w</text><text x="20%" y="36%" class="corridor-text">1s</text><text x="20%" y="65%" class="corridor-text">4s</text><text x="35%" y="21%" class="corridor-text">1e</text><text x="65%" y="21%" class="corridor-text">2e</text><text x="50%" y="36%" class="corridor-text">2s</text><text x="50%" y="55" class="corridor-text">2n</text><text x="50%" y="65%" class="corridor-text">5s</text><text x="80%" y="36%" class="corridor-text">3s</text><text x="80%" y="65%" class="corridor-text">6s</text><text x="94%" y="50%" class="corridor-text">6e</text><text x="80%" y="80%" class="room-text">9</text></svg></figure><p>Initially, all doors are closed except the outer ones - 2n, 4w, 6e and 8s.</p><p>The computers open and close the following doors:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table class="va-table"><thead><tr><th scope="column">#</th><th scope="column">Open</th><th scope="column">Close</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">1</th><td>1s 2s 3s</td><td>1e 2e 7e</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">2</th><td>1e 2e 4e 7e</td><td>2n 4w 6e 8s</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">3</th><td>3s 4e 4s</td><td>3s 4w 4e 6e</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">4</th><td>4w 4e 5e 6e</td><td>1s 2s 3s 4s 5s 6s</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">5</th><td>3s 4w 5e</td><td>1s 2s 4e</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">6</th><td>2s 4w 5e 6e</td><td>3s 4e 4s 5s 6s</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">7</th><td>4w 5s 7e</td><td>1s 2s 5e</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">8</th><td>6s 6e 8e</td><td>3s 5s 5e 7e</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">9</th><td>2n 4w 8s 6e</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Logic for computer 3 both opens and closes 3s and 4e. In practice, this results in it toggling them every time it's used. So, it's the only computer that has an effect when used repeatedly.</p><p>If you have the G.E.C.K. already and just want the quickest path, use the computers in rooms 2, 3, 1, 7, 8 and 9, and the way will be clear (2, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 is another way). If you need to visit the side rooms (or just want to), go 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 8, 9 to open up all exits at the same time. The game is practically over, but you may still want to pick up the Adv. Power Armor MKII, the best armor in the game, from the room to the left. The soldiers in both rooms are unarmed, for some reason. If you want to get in there quickly, go 2, 1 and 4, and you'll then have access to both side areas. When you're done there, use 6, then go back to 2 and begin anew with the "quickest path" described above.</p><p>Once you get to room 9, you can use a Tool (you can steal one from a scientist in the barracks area; a Super Tool Kit won't work) on the loose wires to cut the electricity to the floor if you pass a Repair check. This means you get 1000 xp and won't take any more damage from the electrical shocks, in case you have unfinished business on any of the higher levels.</p><p>To move beyond room 10, you need to carry a G.E.C.K. Even if you didn't stop to speak to the Elder or Frobisher, your character will suggest there may be a G.E.C.K. around, and thanks to a cosmic coincidence there is, in the side room to the right. (Apparently they brought it from Vault 13 along with the prisoners.) If you like explosions, use the G.E.C.K. on the door instead of opening it in the normal way. You may take some damage, though.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you have extremely high Traps and Lockpick values (say, 100% and 200% respectively), you can disable the electric fields on the doors and then pick them for 115 xp each time. This is not really recommended, though. The Lockpick penalty will drop for each door you open, but only if you're using the skill and not a lockpick item.</p></aside><p>There's something more to the maze room than meets the eye. One of the terminals (selected randomly each game) actually contains an "Easter egg", which is found by using the Repair skill on it. If you pass a Science check and it's the right terminal, you'll get a reward, but only if you have tagged any of the skills listed below, and that skill is also at 100% or more. The skills are checked in the order given, and once one is found that qualifies, that's what you get whether you want it or not. You can only get one egg.</p><dl><dt>Science</dt><dd>Opens all doors in the maze (using the terminals afterwards will open and close them as usual).</dd><dt>Repair</dt><dd>Creates 1 Magic 8-Ball and restores electricity to the floor if you cut the wires so you can cut them again for 1000 xp (the floor doesn't actually start discharging unless you leave the map and come back).</dd><dt>Gambling</dt><dd>Creates $2000-5000, 1 Loaded Dice and 1 Pack of Marked Cards.</dd><dt>Outdoorsman</dt><dd>Creates 1 YK42B Pulse Rifle.</dd><dt>Throwing</dt><dd>Creates 10-20 Plasma Grenade.</dd><dt>First aid</dt><dd>Creates 1 Psycho, 1 Buffout, 1 First Aid Kit, 1 Mentats and 1 Stimpak.</dd><dt>Doctor</dt><dd>Creates 2-4 Buffout, 1 Medical Supplies, 1 Poison, 2-4 Jet, 2-4 Super Stimpak, 2-4 Psycho, 1-2 Doctor's Bag and 2-4 Stimpak.</dd><dt>Traps</dt><dd>Creates 2-4 Plastic Explosives, 2-4 Dynamite, 2-4 Electronic Lockpick MKII and 1 Motion Sensor.</dd><dt>Speech</dt><dd>Creates 1 Alien Blaster.</dd></dl><p>Some skills are better than others, I suppose. (All my characters would get the Speech egg, except for the stupid one who'd probably get none at all.) In any case, you get 2500 xp for "living through the puzzle room" when you reach the next level. Should you want to go back this way, use the terminal in room 6 and the right doors will open (if you didn't open up the whole maze, that is).</p><p>In the presidential area you can talk to three people. Vice-president Bird is just crazy and spouts Dan Quayle quotes, or at least quotes attributed to Quayle. (Many quaylisms have later been re-attributed to George W Bush, which I suppose says something about how authentic you can expect them to be.) The President will give you background info, but what he says doesn't really affect anything. He's got quite a lot of dialogue, though, some of which you'll only see if you try to get out of conversation early, or if you threaten to kill him. And he <em>is</em> a talking head, so hear him out. (If you're stupid and talk to the President he'll always call for the guards, but this doesn't do anything.) What you need from him is the Presidential Access Key, which you must take from his corpse one way or another. Super Stimpaks will do and you should have lots and lots by now. My favorite is to save, Sneak and blast him away with one critical hit from the .44 Magnum. Blam! Splaff. Sorry.</p><aside class="red"><p>Did I tell you about the time I took out half a squad of Enclave guards in the detention area in one round using the .44 Magnum, killing three with instant kill criticals, knocking one unconscious and wounding a fifth? Bwahahahahah.</p></aside><p>Dr Curling in the northwestern corner of the map is something else entirely. When you talk to him about DNA, evolution, humanity and stuff you get plenty of chances to make a Speech check and thus awaken his (deeply) dormant conscience ("a big concept to swallow"). He'll release the FEV virus into the ventilation system, earning you 5000 xp and killing off most scientists and civilians in a few minutes (but not important ones like the President). This does not impose a time limit on you however (snoozing 10 minutes using the Pip-Boy to get rid of the scientists is harmless), and you, your NPCs and the prisoners will be protected from the effects of the virus. Dr Curling then tells you to go destroy the computer like the others did.</p><p>All three of these people will sound the alarm if you threaten to kill them too much (you need to threaten the President to see all of his dialogue, but don't push it). None of them will call the guards if you let them live even if they know who you are. Actually there's not so much loot on this level (only two books in Curling's room).</p><p>The stairs to the reactor level can be found north of the President's office. Down here you find the reactor computer, the one everyone's telling you to blow up, in the northeast room. Dropping a Dynamite next to any of the three consoles will do the trick. If the three scientists are still around you must wait until they give you space (or use the push command), since as usual critters will see it as an attack if you drop explosives near them. Also move away a little bit from the computer or you'll take some electrical damage following the explosion. Destroying the computer yields 10,000 xp.</p><aside class="red"><p>Using the Yellow Reactor Keycard on the computer consoles does nothing, in case you're wondering. South of this room is a large inaccessible chamber with an elevator, a door entry computer and two important-looking terminals. Possibly the keycard - and the Red Reactor Keycard, which is in the database but not in the game - was supposed to be used there, but this was scrapped.</p></aside><p>More loot in the lockers. You can talk to the scientist Tom Murray in the room to the southwest and ask him about the reactor. You can tell him to shut down the reactor and he'll do it (12,500 xp). This has the same effect as blowing up the reactor computer - but you can now go and do that as well, earning 10,000 xp more. Strangely enough, if you say you're going to kill him he screams for the guards, but unless you attack no one cares although there's a soldier right there in the room. If you released the FEV Murray won't die but you can't get into conversation with him, so having Murrary shut down the reactor is best from an xp point of view. As if it matters at this stage in the proceedings, as the saying goes.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you're wearing power armor of any type, got the <a href="#car">Car</a>, and have one NPC with you, Murray will complain about your armor, but just dare him to report you and you'll get the usual dialogue.</p></aside><p>Blowing up or shutting down the computer starts a 10-minute countdown. This is how much time you have - real time, as long as you're not in combat mode - to get off the oil rig. (Should you fail, at least you get to see the animation of the rig blowing up.) The blast doors by the stairs to the puzzle room from the presidental area will close (leaving the puzzle and detention areas inaccessible), and the door to the emergency stairs will open; taking them brings you to the barracks area.</p><aside class="red"><p>You may read in a few walkthroughs that the emergency staircase won't always open when you disable the reactor and you must then fiddle with the computers in order to clear this route, or that they do open but you can use the computers to clear the way past the detention area instead. This is all incorrect, however. The state of the blast doors will always change when you start the reactor countdown, and only then.</p></aside><p>Now for the finale. When you arrive on the foyer map after blowing up the reactor, there'll be soldiers standing about in the small room. They're Sergeant Rock - er, sorry, Granite and his men. They'll tell you that Frank Horrigan, the huge fellow you've met in the desert and possibly watched in a few video recordings, has taken position by the exit and won't let anyone leave. With very good Speech you can convince Granite that their only chance lies in helping you take out Horrigan (you may have to try a few times), and they'll then spill into the foyer (1500 xp). The doors to the detention area will be closed (see note above).</p><p>Frank Horrigan has a talking head, so you should save and walk up to him. Once you're done talking he attacks (if you have IN&lt;4 he attacks right away), and the turrets with him. He'll shoot you with his End Boss Plasma Gun until it's out of ammo, then switch to his End Boss Knife, or if you're armed with an HtH weapon he usually goes for the knife right away (in rare cases he may just settle for kicking you). You'd have to be very tough and lucky (or well prepared) to survive this fight. Instead reload and walk along the bottom of the screen to the computer terminal. Now is the time to activate the counter insurgency measures using the Presidential Access Key. Once you do this the turrets initiate combat and attack Horrigan, so make sure you've recruited Granite's squad first. With both the soldiers and turrets on your side, you can stand aside and watch Horrigan get the shaft in just a few rounds, so a purely diplomatic character can do just fine here. By the way, the door to the dock cannot be opened until Horrigan is defeated.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you activate counter insurgency without having enlisted Sgt. Granite, the troopers will come running to help Horrigan. This will happen if you activated the turrets before setting off the countdown, in which case the turrets open fire on Horrigan as soon as you enter the map. Once the turrets are gone the soldiers and Horrigan all turn on you. The soldiers will also attack you if you attack Horrigan on your own, and conversely if you attack them he'll come running.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you let Horrigan initiate combat, the first door on the right will seal permanently shut. In this case Sgt. Granite's people and any NPCs that may have been shut in won't participate in the fight against Horrigan, but the NPCs will be with you when you get back to San Francisco. Here's a pretty odd thing you can do: Attack Horrigan without letting him talk to you, then run to the exit grid on the right and leave. When you return, Horrigan will initiate dialogue if he's nearby and the door will close. After you kill him, you can't get to the exit... but stepping on the exit grid to the barracks will mysteriously get you safely to the tanker and end the game.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>In case your character is too dumb to access the terminal, or if you didn't get the Presidential Access Key, there's still a way to make this battle easier. It has to be done prior to disabling the reactor, though. You can take out the turrets by firing a few shots, then retreating through the door to the dock or behind the wall by the staircase. When you come back in again, the turrets won't be hostile, so shoot them some more. Repeat until they're all gone. Beating Horrigan in single combat with a good weapon like the Bozar shouldn't be at all impossible. Another reason to do this could be if you want to fight Horrigan "fairly", without the turrets helping either side.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Jacek Kominek points out that another way to take on Horrigan separately is to simply run back to where the turrets can't see you, in the corner above the blast doors. If the doors are open you can run away and end combat after defeating Horrigan, and the turrets won't attack when you return. Jacek also laments the ineffectiveness of melee weapons against Horrigan; the lack of good criticals means they can't measure up to the damage output of a good minigun. But then again, what can?</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>DrämmarnasStig relates a strategy: "After several aimed shots at the eyes with no effect I went for his legs. I crippled one leg and that won the fight for me. Once he runs out of ammo he changes to a melee weapon. From this moment forth I took one shot and used the rest of my AP for backing off, Horrigan never being able to reach me. From my brief experience I would highly recommend aimed shots at his legs (I took the Gauss Rifle for that job)." He'll be able to move just 3 hexes with a crippled leg.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Here's a bug/cheat similar to the vent bug in Navarro. Shoot Horrigan from a distance so he comes running towards you, then step behind the second door to the right and close it (Horrigan seems to be able to fire through the first one). When Horrigan runs into the doorway he'll stop and not attack. You'll then be able to hit him or shoot at him as much as you like with no return fire. This doesn't work if he's got his knife out.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Now's the time to whip out that Mutated Toe from earlier. Use it on Horrigan and... he loses 3 of his max HP. Hold me up, someone. This is exactly what happens if you use it on anyone else. And if you go to New Reno afterwards, the citizens <em>still</em> say "you really should have used the mutated toe on Horrigan".</p></aside><p>Once Horrigan is "killed" (10,000 combat xp) you can talk to his head and torso for some final words. He says he activated the self-destruct mechanism and that you're going to die horribly (although this doesn't seem to do anything that the reactor meltdown wouldn't anyway), then his head pops. Shooting the still living head from a distance instead may confuse the message window (especially for aimed shots) but the result is the same. Or you could just open the door to the dock and the moment you step through you'll see the end animation. After that you'll be treated to various endings for the places you have visited during the game; see the following section for details. This also crosses out <a href="#quest-arroyo5">Retrieve the GECK for Arroyo</a>, whether you have a G.E.C.K. or not.</p><aside class="green"><p>After Horrigan is killed you may be able to get his weapons from his corpse, by killing one of the Enclave troopers (or an NPC) on the same hex and then using the selection arrows in the loot interface. If you click on Horrigan's body your character will run up and face the hex in question. The troopers cannot be pushed into position, but if you enter combat mode they'll come running toward you. Turning the violence level to minimal or none before killing Horrigan is necessary to make this work. Thanks to Sebastian Cassten for telling me about this.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you inadvertently leave your party members behind when the oil rig blows, for instance if you had dropped them off on the dock, you can still save them by going to the bridge of the tanker, pressing "Go" (15,000 xp again) and returning to the rig (hmm!). If you've got time remaining on the countdown timer, you can re-recruit your NPCs and exit to San Francisco once again. It's good for a laugh anyway. Since the trips back and forth are instantaneous as far as the game timer is concerned, you may have a few minutes in which to keep doing this.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>My maximum Rock count, without resorting to recurring random encounters (where they are sometimes plentiful), nor stealing (some kids and random townspeople carry lots), nor trading for them (Buster in NCR restocks them), nor digging up graves, is 111. That includes 19 from Klamath, 2 from the Den, 60 from Modoc, 2 from Redding, 5 from New Reno, 11 from San Francisco and 12 from special encounters (though you'd have to be lucky to get all of those).</p></aside><p>To recap the stuff you can do after you beat the game: designer notes and xp computer in Vault City, Hintbook from Father Tully, dating Miss Kitty, movie at the Golden Globes, grav plates in the chop shop (maybe), and great new dialogue in New Reno and Vault City. Stupid characters cannot do the things in the VC vault, but they can hug Lynette instead. What to do after you get tired of roaming the wasteland for random encounters, or giving yourself unlimited xp using the Hintbook?

Early in the game, this will be a real nuisance and often a nightmare, running into dangerous situations your character is not at all prepared to deal with. It was killap's intention to bring the game closer to what it was originally - you should be afraid of venturing into the wastes. Read those scout manuals, and put a few points into outdoorsman skill and you shouldn't have much trouble. (The encounter rate is dependent upon your computer however, and it can be adjusted. So, if it seems unbearable, check the wiki for help changing it)</p><p>Not only will you have more encounters, there are also many that never existed before. Robbers and raiders could always be certain death for low level parties, but a caravan fending off robbers can be a great opportunity. If you can keep your NPCs out of the fight, wait until the robbers start running out of ammo and then take them down. Some of the weapons you can pick up (for free, and still far away from any town where you could even buy them - if you could afford to,) will almost seem like cheating.</p></aside><p>You'll notice the wasteland is full of critters and creeps who want your hide. When you run into an encounter on the world map, there's an Outdoorsman check to see if you may choose to avoid it. You end an encounter by running to the edge of the map, or, if you have the <a href="#car">Car</a>, using it (even in the middle of combat). Running off the map will put you in the <a href="#car">Car</a> if you have it.</p><aside class="green"><p>It seems that your effective Outdoorsman skill (chance of success <em>before</em> negative modifiers are applied) cannot exceed 95%, meaning there's no point in raising the skill beyond that, or carrying a Motion Sensor if you're already at that skill level.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The xp you gain from successful use of the Outdoorsman skill is equal to 100 plus the difficulty of the check (from 0 to 70 based on encounter zone, not encounter type) minus your skill level (capped at 95). If you're in the <a href="#car">Car</a> you don't always get any xp, indicating it gives you an added independent chance (seemingly 50%) of avoiding encounters.</p></aside><p>Here's a list of beings you may stumble upon. This division of areas is very imprecise and they overlap vastly. Critters may appear in areas below the one where they are listed; especially mantis, wolves and radscorpions appear pretty much all over the map.</p><dl><dt>Northwest</dt><dd>(Arroyo): scorpions, radscorpions, outcasts, fishermen (coast only), war party, hunting party, cannibals, wilders, hermit, rats, pig rats, nomads, silver geckos, holy people, ants, spore plants.</dd><dt>North</dt><dd>(Klamath, Den, Modoc): highwaymen, golden geckos, mole rats, wild brahmin, slavers (and slaves), trappers, Den caravan, Vault City caravan, merchant and guards, farmers, homeless people, bandits, moonshiners, mantis, rave party, robbers.</dd><dt>Northeast</dt><dd>(Vault City, Gecko): merchant party, wild dogs, ghoul crazies, patrol unit, mutated rats, mutated mole rats, mutated pig rats, ghoul scavengers, caravan.</dd><dt>East</dt><dd>(Broken Hills, NCR): marauders, raiders, Rangers, caravan, Unity patrol, rogues.</dd><dt>Central</dt><dd>(Redding, New Reno): yakuza, mobsters, gang, traveler, fire geckos, claim jumpers, homesteaders, prospectors, bootleggers, Redding caravan, wolves, New Reno caravan.</dd><dt>South</dt><dd>(Military Base, Vault 13): remnants of the Master's army, deathclaws, NCR Rangers, caravan.</dd><dt>Southwest</dt><dd>(Navarro, SF): floaters, centaurs, Enclave patrol, Hubologists, press gang, aliens, caravan, mercenaries.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>Some encounters come in the form of "X fending off Y", where X and Y are groups you would find in that area. In these cases, if you move out of the way you won't be attacked until they're finished with each other. Note that if you go into a cave and then come out again while this is going on, they'll forget that they were fighting, and normally hostile groups will then turn on you. In other encounters different groups work together, such as "raiders searching with wild dogs", "robbers and highwaymen" or "radscorpions hiding among spore plants". In some encounters where there are two separate groups (e.g., "aliens and deathclaws") you'll start out fighting one group, while the other will be idle and not react to your presence until combat ends (or you attack them). This will allow you to leave the map or position yourself before fighting the other group.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Don't drop important items on the ground in random encounter maps, because if you leave them there when you exit to the world map they're gone forever. This also goes for NPCs!</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Merchants may trade with you depending on the sign of your karma (some will dismiss you for being a do-gooder, others for being a meanie). Inventory depends on location: New Reno merchants will have lots of drugs, for example, and VC merchants will have lots of healing items. One caravan in the NCR-Vault 13 area is a good source of Scout Handbooks. Another in the SF area has a 10% chance of carrying the rare XL70E3 each time you meet them. Some other critters can be traded with as well (e.g., fishermen, hermits, farmers), though they have nothing of value. (There is actually 1 chance in 100 that a fisherman will carry a Laser Pistol; they'll offer to sell it for $10,000, which is of course much more than it's worth.)</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The traveler can put New Reno and Vault City on your world map.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>In the homeless people and farmers encounters there may be a critter that is using the male, bald "yellow pyjamas" model, but which counts as a child (you can tell from his floating dialogue), and killing him makes you a Childkiller.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If you meet trappers, you can pimp <a href="#npcs--miria">Miria</a> or <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a> once to each trapper (regardless of gender) for one Gecko Pelt and one Golden Gecko Pelt if you don't have enough money to pay for them (drop your money first). If you're not married you can sleep with the trapper yourself, but you'll get poisoned. If you have IN&lt;4, each trapper you talk to will give you a Gecko Pelt. Stochastic adds: "When in dialogue with the trappers, if you have enough money to purchase a normal Gecko Pelt, but not enough to buy a Golden Gecko Pelt, you can purchase the golden pelts for free! This only works for the in-dialogue trading, not the formal barter interface."</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The rave party encounter found around the Den is extra rare because it happens only during certain hours (7 p.m. to midnight). You can actually get infinite chems in this encounter. There will be one or two people selling booze and a few others running around who sell Mentats, Buffout and Psycho. When you pay for a chem, your money goes into their inventory and they try to walk up to you and use a newly created chem dose on you. If you move away the chem will be left on the ground instead for you to pick up. When you're done, kill the partiers or just steal the money. You can also have sex with the partiers if you like. To do this you must first use a skill on them (Steal, First Aid or Doctor); this will give you an extra line of dialogue. Just ask them until they agree, and gender is not an object.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>As pointed out by Jon Lynch, some people in random encounters will let you steal freely from them, to wit: the hunting party, Hubologists, bootleggers and moonshiners.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The number of critters in an encounter depends to some extent on the size of your own party. For instance, Enclave patrols will usually consist of three soldiers if you have a party of 1-3 people, but can come in squads of seven if you have a full group. Volcano draws some evil conclusions: "I have found a use for all of the useless NPCs. When I am trying to level up and acquire loot by fighting Enclave patrols, I prefer to leave my good NPCs behind. Otherwise, they end up taking a lot of damage, and take a lot of time or Stimpaks to heal up again. The problem is, when you are alone you find almost exclusively three-man patrols. Taking along a disposable NPC lets you encounter more big patrols."</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The best place to level up late in the game is the strip of desert between San Francisco and New Reno. Good xp encounters include tough aliens, deathclaws, floaters and centaurs (particularly the last ones are easy), but avoid those pesky fire geckos.</p></aside><p>If your karma drops really low (-501, although the wanted posters will appear at -500) or if you count as a Childkiller, you'll sometimes run into bounty hunters. The minimum number in a group is two, and the maximum number is four, plus one if they're after you for killing kids, plus one if you're level 19 or more. Their toughness and equipment will depend on your level (with variations within each group):</p><dl><dt>1-6</dt><dd>Leather jacket, Hunting Rifle, Desert Eagle.</dd><dt>7-12</dt><dd>Leather armor, Assault Rifle, Super Sledge, Sniper Rifle.</dd><dt>13-18</dt><dd>Combat armor, Laser Rifle, Frag Grenades, Power Fist.</dd><dt>19-99</dt><dd>Power armor, Gauss Rifle, Plasma Grenades, Avenger Minigun.</dd></dl><p>Needless to say this can be a pain, as especially the later encounters are much more dangerous than the xp reward warrants. You get -10 karma for each bounty hunter you kill, so that would seem like something of a downward spiral. If you're only wanted because of your karma you can make the wanted posters disappear by climbing above -501 again.</p><p>And now for some overly detailed data on... the Mysterious Stranger! If you for some reason got this perk, the chance that he or she will show up in an encounter is equal to 30+LK*2 out of 100. Their HP and armor state (though they will always have the leather jacket look) depend on your level as follows:</p><dl><dt>9-14</dt><dd>50 HP, leather armor.</dd><dt>15-18</dt><dd>70 HP, combat leather jacket.</dd><dt>19-22</dt><dd>90 HP, metal armor mk II.</dd><dt>23-26</dt><dd>110 HP, combat armor mk II.</dd><dt>27-99</dt><dd>130 HP, power armor.</dd></dl><p>The female 9-14 variety has 2 HP more than the male, i.e. 52 (ooh). Their weapon changes as follows (in each encounter they will have one of the weapons listed):</p><dl><dt>9-13</dt><dd>Hunting Rifle, FN FAL.</dd><dt>14-19</dt><dd>Assault Rifle, Combat Shotgun.</dd><dt>20-26</dt><dd>Laser Rifle, H&K CAWS.</dd><dt>27-99</dt><dd>H&K G11.</dd></dl><aside class="green"><p>The Mysterious Stranger can be exploited for infinite ammo. Whenever you enter an empty spot on the world map there's a chance that the stranger is standing nearby. Use Steal to get some ammo and Stimpaks. If you get caught, nothing happens. After you steal their stuff, enter combat and spend a round just running around. When combat ends they'll start moving away, but if you quickly save then load the game they'll stop. Steal again - new ammo. If they manage to get away you can just leave the map and repeat the whole thing. Also, on some random maps after combat is over the stranger doesn't quite get off the map when running away from you afterwards (works on some mountain maps), meaning if you position yourself correctly you can steal and enter combat repeatedly without having to worry about them getting away. You can get plenty of Micro Fusion Cell or 4.7mm Caseless ammo doing this. Finally there's a comparatively minor bug: a stranger carrying a Hunting Rifle will have Shotgun Shells, not .223 FMJ.</p></aside><p>In many mountain encounters you'll find a cave opening which you can go through. (There's also one treeless map with a cave opening but no actual cave.) Most often you'll find varying quantities of radscorpions, mole rats, geckos or deathclaws, which are generally not worth taking on, but once in a great while you may come across a cave full of human robbers (the chance is 1 in 13 for each cave, plus you must also pass a Luck check; if you find a completely empty cave you'll know you failed the check). These come in different varieties depending on your level:</p><dl><dt>1-5</dt><dd>Leather armor (jacket look), 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG, Spear.</dd><dt>6-10</dt><dd>Leather armor, Scoped Hunting Rifle, Desert Eagle, Plated Boxing Gloves (!).</dd><dt>11-14</dt><dd>Combat armor, Power Fist, Super Cattle Prod, .223 Pistol, HK P90c.</dd><dt>15-99</dt><dd>Combat armor, Pulse Rifle, FN FAL, H&K G11E, Turbo Plasma Rifle.</dd></dl><p>Many of them carry a lot of ammo. Very worthwhile and not too difficult if you bring friends. Each such cave also comes with three chests full of money and more loot like Stimpaks and grenades; if you're lucky you can find a Super Sledge from level 6, a Power Fist from level 8 or a Plasma Rifle from level 11.</p><p>Apart from general random encounters, there are also special, one-time encounters which often have some kind of humourous twist. It's not exactly known how it's decided how often you get them; Luck, Perception and Outdoorsman are the usual suspects (used to be LK in <em>Fallout</em>, so it's a pretty good bet). Game difficulty also seems to affect this; it'll take significantly longer to find all encounters if you play on hard. There are two kinds of special encounter: those that leave a permanent location on your world map, and those that don't. The first kind will bring up a green circle which is marked "Unknown" at first, the second will just flash a red circle and leave no mark on your world map (so don't drop any items there). The latter kind is identified with the word "red" in the list below.</p><aside class="green"><p>If you decline to enter a special encounter when you first find it, you may come across it again (because the encounter is only flagged as found when you enter the map), but it will have to be in another encounter zone (because the encounter script has a memory of its own). This is also true for encounters with map locations; these will remain on the map marked "Unknown" after you first get them, and are relocated when you run into the encounter again somewhere else. The Cafe is the only one that moves around even when it's been identified, because of a bug.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>In rare cases a special encounter may not leave a location on the world map even though it usually would.</p></aside><p>For each special encounter there's a minimum level to get it, also given in parentheses below. What special encounters you find will depend on the terrain you're in: all special encounters occur in desert areas except for the Bridge which is a mountain encounter, while coast and city areas have no special encounters at all. The Bridge also has the highest relative probability of popping up, so it's usually your first one in any game.</p><p>There's another way in which special encounters distinguish themselves, namely by being "good" or "bad". It does seem, however, that the game itself makes no such distinction, so that perks that raise the probability of finding special encounters will reap you unpleasant ones as well as the beneficial kind. In any case you will find all special encounters regardless of your stats if you just keep playing long enough.</p><aside class="green"><p>There are a few encounters where the map will reset every time you enter it, so dropped items will be lost. These are the Guardian Portal and all three "bad" encounters. They also share the feature that when you leave the area for the first time it remains labelled "Unknown". To make its proper name appear on the world map, simply enter and exit the encounter again (I wouldn't do this for the Toxic waste dump, though!).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can't leave your <a href="#car">Car</a> on a special encounter map unless it is out of fuel, but in that case it will appear properly even on the "resetting" maps.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Often you'll see a single Rock lying on the ground of most of the special encounter maps (to my knowledge, all special encounters but the Cafe of Broken Dreams, plus the Bess encounter). I can't help feeling there is some significance to this. Since the Rocks are randomly placed they can end up on exit grids or behind opaque scenery where you can't get them.</p></aside><h3 id="encounters--good-encounters">Good encounters <a class="header-link" href="#encounters--good-encounters">🔗</a></h3><details id="guardian-of-forever"><summary>A Guardian Portal (8)(Guardian of Forever)</summary><p>You encounter a large stone ring (reference to the Star Trek episode "City on the Edge of Forever"). Walk into it and you'll end up on level 3 of Vault 13 some 80 years ago. Grab the equipment in the lockers and chests, and take the Solar Scorcher from the floor in the armory. When you're tired of the place, use the beeping computer with the water chip, breaking it for 1000 xp and returning to the stone ring which is now inert.</p></details><details id="bridge"><summary>A man guarding a bridge (10) (Bridge)</summary><p>You come across a chasm, spanned by a bridge guarded by a robed figure (reference to Monty Python's <em>The Quest for the Holy Grail</em>). For some reason, the only exit grid (and your <a href="#car">Car</a>!) is on the other side. Talk to the guy and he'll ask you first two straightforward questions and then a game-related trivia question (save and reload if you want to see all the trivia questions, there are three of them). If you answer any question incorrectly, you die. If you answer all questions correctly, he grumbles and leaves. If you answer the final question with a counter-question (Á la <em>Holy Grail</em>), he dies instead and you gain 500 xp. Funny. Take his Bridgekeeper's Robes, which has the same stats as Combat Armor except that it has no radiation protection and weighs less (and makes you look stupid, so I'd give it to a party member). Should you attack the bridgekeeper, he'll summon up an endless swarm of exploding brahmin that will make things difficult for you. You gain 7500 combat xp for killing him, which must be accomplished by inflicting critical hits as he's nearly impervious to harm (it's possible to get him with an instant kill critical, so if you have Better Criticals and are able to keep off the cows, go for it). If you regret attacking him you can avoid the cow or let it explode and then talk to the bridgekeeper.</p><aside class="green"><p>The summoned cows work like the ones in the mad brahmin encounter (see below). The bridgekeeper will only produce a new cow (ending combat in the process) when an existing one is killed, so you can enter combat mode and ignore the non-exploding brahmin until you've dealt with the guardian. You may want to set any NPCs to attack the strongest target.</p></aside><aside class="blue"><p>There's a general engine bug that you may be most likely to take note of here, though it has also been observed with Enclave troops and the pariah dog. Whenever you off a critter with an instant death critical hit that does no damage, the kill doesn't completely register. As a result you get no xp for that critter, death variables will not be set and so on. In the case of the bridgekeeper this means you'll miss out on the 7500 xp if you kill him with such a hit before you wear down his Hit Points. However, there is a sure-fire way to avoid this. The Living Anatomy perk adds 5 points of damage after Damage Resistance is applied, meaning you will never score 0-damage kills against living targets like the bridgekeeper. I knew there was a reason why I like that one.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>IN&lt;4: The conversation will be a bit different.

Guess they got unlucky somehow. Hanging around is a strange dog... who'll start following you if you fail a LK check (there's a new one every 10 seconds). This is the pariah dog, who will give you a Jinxed special perk (I can only assume that it does the same thing as the trait; whether they are cumulative is anyone's guess), and lower your Luck to 1. What's more, the dog takes up one of your NPC slots. Yipes! To get rid of the dog you must kill it, and it has 750 HP. If you can't afford to waste the ammo, but have access to the Sierra Army Depot, go to the second level there and put the dog on the electric floor. Die, mongrel, die! If you're evil you can take the dog to the organ extraction chamber and use it twice on the dog to kill it (which will net you 2 Human Brains (!) and -200 karma). If you kill the dog your LK returns to normal, you lose the Jinxed perk, and the dog will show up again on the Pariahs map (this is probably a bug).</p><aside class="yellow"><p>Some would say this encounter isn't so bad, because there's a bug you may be able to exploit to raise your Luck. There are no guarantees, but this is pretty much how it works: 1) The bug doesn't have anything to do with being able to find the pariah dog in the first place, or how to approach/kill it, rather it's related to how the game keeps track of and modifies (or fails to modify) your stats. 2) To profit from the bug your original Luck must have been 5 or less. If it was 5 you must not have increased it to more than 6 (i.e. by taking the Gain Luck perk or the SF zeta scan), but raising your Luck from 4 to 7 <em>does</em> allow you to gain more Luck. 3) The bug triggers when your Luck has been raised from its initial value by getting Gain Luck and/or a zeta scan before the dog joins you. Although you get the Jinxed perk your Luck doesn't go to 1, and when you kill the dog your LK increases above its current value. 4) The increase in Luck is equal to your current LK minus one; e.g., it will go from 4 to 7, or from 6 or more to 10. 5) If your original Luck was 6 or higher the first part of the bug may still trigger - not losing any Luck - but you don't gain anything, either. 6) Returning to pick the dog up and kill it again works just the same, with your improved Luck as your new "original" value. 7) If you have the Gifted trait, all of the above will proceed as if your Luck was 1 lower, i.e. your original LK must be 6 or less, and it will become 2 when the dog is with you. This also means that using Mutate! to get Gifted and increase your Luck that way is not a valid trigger for the bug. The best way to go about exploiting this bug would probably be to start with LK 4, play until you run into the dog (making sure you don't get to level 12 first and miss out on getting Better Criticals at level 9), give it the slip and get the zeta scan in NCR, then return to the dog and raise your LK to 10. A slightly more complicated plan would be to start with LK 1, get the zeta scan and let the dog raise it to 5, then get Gain Luck and trigger the bug again for LK 10 - basically you get three stat points in exchange for one perk, but this interferes with getting Better Criticals.</p></aside></details><details id="toxic-waste-dump"><summary>Toxic waste dump (6)</summary><p>This area is full of patches of green radioactive goo, with geckos of all kinds moving everywhere.

Eventually you'll get this encounter. Turns out there's a trader named Willy who wants to sell something. Problem is, while talking to him you fall asleep, and must then choose if you want to buy a weapon without knowing exactly what it is. The solution? Use Steal on him before talking to him, or just hit the barter button in dialogue, and you'll see what the item is (he'll have 1-5 of them). What weapons he might be carrying depends on your level:</p><ul><li>1+: Sharpened Spear, Spiked Knuckles</li><li>1-3: Knife, Rock, Spear</li><li>1-5: Throwing Knife, 10mm Pistol, Crowbar, Club, Brass Knuckles, Red Ryder BB Gun</li><li>1-10: Sharpened Pole</li><li>3-5: Combat Knife, Desert Eagle .44, Shotgun, Hunting Rifle</li><li>6-10: 10mm SMG</li><li>6+: 14mm Pistol, Cattle Prod</li><li>8+: Ripper</li><li>10+: Power Fist</li><li>11-15: Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle</li><li>13+: Alien Blaster</li><li>15-20: Minigun</li></ul><p>The script picks one of these weapons at random and then checks to see if you match the level requirement. If the Alien Blaster was picked you must also pass a Luck check or the result is re-rolled. The price Willy asks in dialogue is the weapon's usual barter value (excluding ammo) multiplied by (11 - LK), meaning he'll ask $10,000 for the Blaster if you have Luck 10. You may be able to get a better price just by hitting barter. As an additional curiosity his male guards all carry 9mm Mausers, a rare weapon. This encounter will happen any number of times, and you can kill Willy and his guards and still get the same encounter again.</p><aside class="green"><p>It's possible in this area to get the encounter "A merchant with some guards" which is just your random trader who won't barter with characters of good karma, but the two groups of people look almost identical.

Mynoc, in Arroyo, can tell you even more information about Kaga if you ask him. Basically he was once Arroyos greatest warrior, but got bad influences from outside and became a wicked person. He cheated in the Temple of trials and got cast out of the tribe. He now carries a grudge...</p><p>There are potentially 5 times you will be confronted by Kaga and his companions, and each time they are better equipped than the time before. He will attack you after a brief chat the first time, after that the moment he sees you. If he is hit too much he will try to escape, but his friends will stay on. If he's unconscious or for some other reason fails to escape and you kill him, you will naturally not get any more encounters with him.</p><p>The 5 Kaga encounters occur as follows:</p><ol><li>1st encounter: Most likely to get this in the ocean - Arroyo - Klamath area, also the Klamath - Den trade route.</li><li>2nd encounter: Player level greater than 4.

Found in areas around San Francisco and trade route to Redding.</li></ol><p>Kaga's escape is not always working correctly. Sometimes he will start to run away and then just stand still and do nothing, even if you shoot him. Once you end combat though he will disappear properly. So if this happens you will just have to decide if you want more encounters with him later and then leave him alone for the rest of the fight, or if you rather want him dead now.</p></details></article><hr><article id="npc"><h2 id="npcs">NPCs <a class="header-link" href="#npcs">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>Wow! I feel as if I've passed some arbitrary experience value and gained more power!</p><footer><cite>Marcus</cite></footer></blockquote><p>NPCs or non-player characters are people you pick up during your travels to fight and die for you, and to carry stuff. Equip them with the best armor and/or weapons they can use which you're not using yourself, and let them carry a bunch of Stimpaks for healing.</p><p>If you tell them to heal themselves, or if they decide that's a good idea anyway, they'll use items or skills in this order of preference: Super Stimpak, Stimpak, Healing Powder, Doctor's Bag, First Aid Kit, then whichever healing skill they're best at, which is First Aid for everyone except <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> (First Aid heals 5-15 HP in this case, Doctor 10-25 HP). If they use a skill this counts towards your own limit. If they're holding a weapon you may have to leave dialogue before they can do any healing, because they have to do the putting away animation.</p><p>NPCs can equip any weapon for which they have animation frames (listed below). This means <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> can use a Super Sledge but never a Cattle Prod, <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> is the only one who can use miniguns and large energy weapons, and so on. Also everyone has the basic unarmed animation. That they can equip a weapon does <em>not</em> guarantee they are proficient with it, i.e. you can give <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> the Alien Blaster since it uses the handgun animation, but he can't hit anything since he can't handle Energy Weapons, and <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> can toss grenades though he doesn't really have the Throwing skill. Note that an NPC won't equip a weapon for which they carry no ammo, even if they can use it, and won't equip a weapon that doesn't suit their current combat settings.</p><aside class="green"><p>A few weapons use animations that aren't too obvious: the 14mm Pistol and .223 Pistol use the SMG animation, and the Tommy Gun uses the rifle animation instead of SMG.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The "throw" animation is used for Grenades, Rocks, Flares and such; Spears and Throwing Knives use the animation frames of those weapons when thrown. Note that an NPC can only use grenades if their weapon preference is set to "None", which prevents <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> from using such weapons even though they have the animations.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A weird thing you can do is to equip an NPC with a lit Flare. Make sure they have no other weapon, light the Flare, give it to them and make them ready it. They will effectively become a light source, and what's more, this effect stays indefinitely even after the Flare has disappeared. You can do this for everyone who can equip Flares, i.e. <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, <a href="#npcs--davin">Davin</a>, <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> and <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a>. You can probably guess that it looks <em>very</em> odd to have them all running around in a big group at night. You can set <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> to close combat mode and let him rush forward to illuminate your enemies at night, although this should be marginally useful at best. You can actually do this with your own character, but the effect wears off when you switch maps.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You should make a habit of entering the custom combat settings for each NPC as you find them, so that they conform to your strategy and preferences as well as whatever weaponry you have provided them with.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>NPCs never get radiated or poisoned. They will suffer normal after-effects from chems, though (like losing ST from Buffout or AP from Jet), and not only can they get addicted, but they can seemingly have multiple concurrent and cumulative withdrawal effects. In the case of most chems you can wait this out, but Jet addiction is permanent and the Jet Antidote doesn't work on NPCs, so you risk reducing them to wrecks with just one or a few AP. Furthermore, leveling up will interact oddly with drug use, since their current stats change without regard for temporary effects. An NPC leveling up with raised stats will have the appropriate penalties applied to his new stats, ending up below his proper values. Conversely, an NPC leveling up while in the state of short- or long-term withdrawal will effectively receive a lasting boost when the withdrawal wears off. In either case, the next level up (if there is one) will return things to normal.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>If an NPC dies, and you then save and load the game or leave the map and return, the body will be gone and any carried equipment gone with it (unless they had already dropped it as a result of being fried or blown up). This happens even before you recruit them. Also beware that if an NPC dies and you save the game while still in combat mode, loading that save invariably seems to freeze the game badly at end of turn.</p></aside><p>NPCs in your party won't turn on you if you accidentally hit them in combat (although this could happen in the unpatched game, leading among other things to the "apathetic Vic" bug). However, should ever a party member happen to hit a neutral or "friendly" critter (unless they have a green outline), or should an ally accidentally hit a party member, you'll soon have a fight on your hands you might not like. Another reason to save often, folks.</p><p>If an NPC gets hurt by an explosive charge placed by you, they'll attack you for one round and then drop it. If you attack an NPC that's not currently in your party, they'll fight back. Whether you can recruit them again after running from the fight depends on their script. NPCs fall into roughly four categories: those who will be peaceful if you leave and return (<a href="#npcs--laddie">Laddie</a>, <a href="#npcs--robodog">Robodog</a>); those who will be peaceful after you let them initiate combat once, leave and return (<a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>, <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a>); those who carry a grudge but can be recruited if you manage to talk to them before they can attack (<a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>); and those who will in most cases turn permanently hostile or incommunicable (<a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>, <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a>, <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a>). The <a href="#npcs--brain-bot">Brain Bot</a> is a special case since it won't turn hostile at all if shot at, but will turn permanently hostile if stolen from. Also depending on script and location surrounding critters may turn permanently hostile, too - this happens if you attack <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> in downtown Klamath or <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> anywhere in Gecko.</p><p>Most NPCs belong to local teams before you recruit them and after being dropped off in their home locations, and will attack you if you fight people there; this goes for <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, the Modoc NPCs, <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a>, <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>, <a href="#npcs--robodog"><a href="#npcs--robodog">Robodog</a></a> and <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>. Except for <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> and the Modoc NPCs they won't turn hostile as long as you don't attack them directly, though depending on the circumstances it may be difficult to recruit them later.</p><p>You can barter freely with NPCs, or use the Steal interface for quicker access (all attempts to steal or plant items will be successful). Make sure you don't try to steal from an NPC not currently in your party, though, since if you fail this will generally have the same effect as attacking them.</p><aside class="green"><p>Beware that if you access the inventory of some party members while they're unconscious, this will have the same effect as stealing from them while they're not in your party, although they still remain with you. Notably, <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> and <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> will refuse to communicate from that point, reducing their usefulness, and <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> will turn permanently hostile once you dismiss him from your service. In v1.0 this could apparently also trigger from friendly fire (the patch notes state NPCs will not turn hostile "under most circumstances").</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There is a glitch or oversight you can take advantage of to make NPCs act as mules in an almost <em>Fallout</em>-like fashion. Matt Sampson: "I've found a method to give NPCs infinite carrying capacity, at the expense of a little less than half their Action Points. First you tell your comrades to wait for you. Then you go into barter and trade the stuff to them like you normally do. You will notice that instead of evaluating the goods by their weight, your NPCs evaluate the goods by price. Thus, you can weigh them down with whatever goods you like. I believe I once gave <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> 800 pounds of gear." Note that if you give them really much (more than you can unload in one bartering session) you'll have to get their stuff by using Steal.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Sometimes after trading equipment to NPCs you may find that they exceed their Carry Weight allowance unexpectedly. The reason for this is that on occasion they reload weapons in their inventory that they're not using, which because of the way ammo weight is calculated will cause their total weight carried to go up (also see below for how they can actually increase the amount of ammo in their possession). If you find this excruciatingly annoying, always give them one or a few pounds less to carry than what the combat screen reports they can take.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>There's an infinite ammo bug found by Raymond Schulz: Give two or more guns of the same type to an NPC who can use them, making sure that none is loaded and that there's some ammo available. When you press "use best weapon", all of the guns will be loaded using the same ammo! Unequip the wielded weapon, empty them all and repeat. Only one ammo "item" or fraction thereof will be used, e.g., if you do the trick with <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>, a BB Gun and a big heap of BB's, no more than 20 will go into each rifle. Something similar will happen when NPCs reload guns in combat; for instance, after equipping a 10mm SMG, reloading and firing a burst, <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> carried a bunch of SMGs that were each just one bullet short of a full clip, while the weapon he had fired was somehow fully loaded.</p></aside><p>NPC leveling works like this: every time you level up, then for each NPC currently in your party who hasn't levelled up lately there is a chance that that NPC will gain a level. If they don't, the probability will be higher next time, so it's no big deal. If you want to, you can save before leveling up and do it many times to get a good result, but there's no guarantee that any specific NPC will even have the possibility of leveling up. Note that they don't have to be with you when you earn xp, only at the specific moment when you level up.</p><p>Most NPCs can level up four or five times during a game. Each time he (for they are all male, or robots) will gain some Hit Points, Action Points, Carry Weight and combat prowess in a non-random fashion. Most of them also gain Critical Chance, Melee Damage and/or Sequence, though <a href="#npcs--lenny">Lenny</a> and <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> are exceptions.

'We need traffic signs', I said. But did they listen? Noooo... let's not listen to ol' Lumpy!</p><footer><cite>Lumpy</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Here I'll gather some details and information on the car, which is a major convenience factor in the game and a very nifty feature. It will let you zoom between locations and makes it a lot easier to avoid random encounters when you get them. How you get it is detailed in the Den and Gecko sections. If your IN is below 4 you have to chew Mentats at least once to enable the dialogue choices that will earn you the car. You can always kill Skeeter for the car part, but Smitty is another matter (and raising Repair to 110% that early in the game to fix the car yourself is a bit unrealistic).</p><p>The car runs on energy supplied by Small Energy Cells or Micro Fusion Cells. You'll see how much "gas" there is left in the car when you look at it, measured in a percentage. One full pack (40) of Small Energy Cell will refuel the car by 20 percentage units. One full pack of Micro Fusion Cell (50) will refuel the car by 50 percentage units. (You will see different numbers elsewhere, but these are correct.) Use your chosen fuel on the middle or forward section of the car to refuel it.</p><aside class="green"><p>What fuel you should use depends mostly on what weapons you're using. If you're into ranged combat, using SEC to refuel the car is most often the sensible choice, since several good weapons like the Pulse and Plasma Rifles use MFC. On the other hand, SEC is used by Power Fists, the Pulse Pistol and the Alien Blaster. I always end up with more than enough of both. In terms of bartering the two fuel types are exactly on a par.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Using SEC or MFC on a party member will refuel the car. Interesting, eh? It even works if the car is not on the same map! This is probably because the car is technically an NPC.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Refuelling the car can be tricky because of a bug. If, after you choose the backpack icon and select the SEC or MFC to use on the car, your mouse pointer happens to be over a critter or an object, your character might try to interact with that critter or object instead. If this happens, scroll the screen a little in whichever direction and try again. (This bug is not actually car-specific.) Also if you stand next to the trunk when refuelling, this may cause you to access the trunk instead.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Pathfinder perk will reduce your fuel consumption by the same proportion that it diminishes travel time, i.e. 20% (see Character Design for a note on Pathfinder). It would still be a stupid way to spend a perk.</p></aside><p>If you run out of fuel, the car will appear as a green circle on the world map marked "Car Outta Fuel". You can go there at any time to refuel and be off again. If you happen to be within a town circle at the moment this happens, the car will be on the town map instead.</p><aside class="green"><p>The moment when you run out of fuel is critical, because a car bug may strike and teleport the car circle across the map or make it vanish altogether. It should be a rare event in a normal game, but if you spend several years cruising the wasteland you might see it happen. To avoid this you may want to refuel regularly, and save, of course.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>It can reportedly also happen that the car circle ends up within a town circle, and you won't be able to get to the car because you'll end up entering the town instead (where the car won't be). In this case the car is irretrievably lost and you should revert to a saved game immediately. Note that as long as some small part of the car circle is outside the town map square, you should be able to get to the car as long as you click outside of that square.</p></aside><p>There are four different upgrades available in the game for the car, one of them only after you complete the game. One is available in the Den (regulator), one in NCR (blower) and two in the same place in New Reno (engine/trunk and grav-plates); see these areas for details.</p><p>The car's trunk is invaluable to store items you pick up, excess ammo and weaponry (also if you're the kind of player who wants to keep used quest items at hand just in case... but keep in mind the "too many items" bug!). Early in the game it can seem limitless, but you'll find out it's not. The trunk's capacity for holding things (250 to begin with, 275 after the upgrade) is based on item size, a factor which is not displayed in the game but is 7-15 for armor, 1-6 for weapons and 0-1 for most other items and drugs (a Rope and a Lighter are both size 1). Some weightless items like Jet have size 1, so you may want to keep these in your inventory. Another important fact is that ammo (including rockets and fuel tanks) does not take up space in the trunk, so you should happily store any ammo you're not using for the moment in the trunk. 9mm ball and BB's are exceptions, but you never find too much of those. Thrown weapons like grenades are not ammo and do take up trunk space.</p><aside class="green"><p>Since later in the game you should always have more spare weaponry than the shopkeepers can trade you cash or ammo for, there's virtually never any need to trade away ammo. Even if you don't really plan to use a Rocket Launcher at all, there's no reason to sell rockets you've found before you've sold everything else you're not going to keep, such as, I don't know, excess Combat Shotguns. So generally you should constantly be trading bulky weapons for all sorts of ammo you think might become even remotely useful.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>Before the patch, the car was one of the most bugged features in the game. It can still happen after the patch that the car simply disappears (but remember there's a couple of places where your car may move but not be lost, see Raiders and New Reno). Some have said that if this happens you can usually find the car somewhere it shouldn't be (Broken Hills, New Reno, NCR, or wherever), but if you have the option you should reload or revert to an earlier save, since you won't necessarily see the car again at all.</p></aside></article><hr><article><h2 id="stupid">Stupid <a class="header-link" href="#stupid">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>Ooooh! Butunz!</p><footer><cite>The Chosen One</cite></footer></blockquote><p>Playing a game with Intelligence lower than 4 will be quite different, so I'm giving it a section of its own. The basic difference is of course that most people won't talk to you, or they won't give you quests, plus there's the fact that you almost never get to use a computer. You'll notice straight away in Arroyo and Klamath that you can't do as many things or gain as many bonuses, and as a result your character will level up much more slowly as you progress through areas. You'll miss out on many juicy enhancements to your character like the free Unarmed training in SF, the combat implants, training in Arroyo and Klamath, and so on. In this way the stupid game is not very balanced: a difference of a single char point to IN and suddenly half of the game is taken from you. But I suppose it would have been difficult to implement in any other way, and we should be glad it's there at all.</p><p>If you're going to play a stupid game you should keep your IN at 3 - you're getting few skill points as it is! Using the Skilled trait may seem like a good remedy, but I say it's not worth it. The fact that you get fewer skill points is balanced by the fact that you don't have to invest in Speech, and also of course there aren't many skills you really <em>need</em>. To begin with you should choose one combat skill and stick to that for a while at least, Small Guns being the obvious choice since it will carry you through the entire game, more or less. Devote early skill points to Lockpick for looting and Doctor for convenience, put later points into Big Guns for a secondary weapon skill, and study all those books you find.</p><p>You can usually do the stuff or parts of stuff that doesn't require dialogue, e.g., you can fix Bess' leg in Modoc but not sell her to Grisham, and you can help Charlie in Vault City with RadAway. You get xp for finding the Raiders even though you never got that quest, and you get xp for clearing the Redding mine even though you didn't buy the deed. Sometimes you can "simulate" quests if you know what's needed to trigger certain reactions, e.g., you can kill the Dragon or Lo Pan with Super Stimpaks and then collect a reward from the other.</p><p>Since you level up so slowly, most big battles will be much too difficult for you when you first come across them. For instance, you won't be able to free <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> without killing Metzger's band of slavers, and you couldn't possibly do that at level 3 without playing dirty. Likewise you'll most likely have to circumvent the raiders and the wanamingos for some time. I was able to take out Darion's gang at level 9 by using Plasma Grenades and saving and loading a lot during combat, but only returned for the raiders and wanamingos after I got a Gauss Rifle in San Francisco.</p><p>Area progression will work roughly like this: first you go to Klamath where you can get the location of the Den from Torr. In the Den you can get the location of Vault City from <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> - only you'd have to kill Metzger first! Since you probably can't, let's just head east in a random fashion. Eventually, after stumbling across Modoc, you come to Vault City purely by chance. You don't get Gecko on your map, but the central computer in the vault will give you the four other towns and Vault 15 (which can also be found from NCR). Vault 13 can be found in Vault 15, or by following the deathclaws. Next you'll have to find the Military Base on your own, and use the Survey Map there to find San Francisco. Matthew will put Navarro on your map and that's it.</p><p>In a strictly stupid game you normally wouldn't get the <a href="#car">Car</a>. This sucks, so what can we do about it? First, go to Gecko and kill Skeeter for the car part (you won't have to fight the other ghouls). Steal Lynette's Mentats while passing through Vault City. Return to the Den with $2750 (you should have just enough) and the two car parts, eat the Mentats, talk to Smitty and install the parts. You'll now be able to drive around like in a normal game, at least if you're able to find or trade for enough fuel (I had no problem with that). Note that you need Mentats again to get the upgrades in NCR and New Reno, but you can manage without them.</p><p>NPC management could be difficult. You can get a few of them (<a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>, <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a>, <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a>, and you can of course use Mentats to recruit others), but you won't really be able to talk to any of them except <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> and <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a>. This means, for instance, that you can't get them to put away their weapons as you enter NCR, and you can't drop them off anywhere. Anyway, since CH is largely wasted on a stupid character as far as dialogue in concerned, maybe you won't be able to have many followers to begin with. It's up to you if you want to go solo or if you need the edge in combat.</p><p>As you reach the last few areas on the mainland, prepare for your game to get a little backward. In a normal game I tend to avoid stupid shortcut techniques and instead take on each challenge in the "proper" order armed with whatever NPCs and equipment I have at the time. In a stupid game this may not be feasible, which leads to some weird choices. For instance, should you invest in perks and weaponry so you could take on the mutants at the Military Base and get the Power Armor? Or should you amass weapons and cash so you could buy the Power Armor in SF instead? But if you're going to do that, why not simply drive to Navarro, waltz in and pick up the Advanced Power Armor for free? In short, the temptation to resort to stupid shortcut techniques will increase as the linearity of the game breaks down. I would recommend that you resist for as long as you are able.</p><p>For quests and stuff there are always Mentats, which I suppose you could theoretically keep in unlimited or at least generous supply. However, this would seem to defeat the point of playing a stupid game to begin with. Therefore Mentats should only be used when there is something you feel you absolutely need to do like getting the <a href="#car">Car</a>, getting a certain area like the Sierra Army Depot on your map, or when you need to meet the requirements of a favorite perk like Bonus Rate of Fire.</p><p>There are a few ways of increasing your IN permanently during the game: the Gain Intelligence perk, the Yellow Memory Module, and the Hubologist alignment in San Francisco. Naturally you should stay away from these or your stupid game won't be stupid any more, assuming you start out at IN 3. The Smooth Talker perk requires IN 4 to get, but once you have it it'll make you talk unstupidly if it raises your IN above 3 for dialogue purposes.</p><p>Here's a brief summary of what can be done at the various locations:</p><strong>Arroyo:</strong> You can kill the plants for Hakunin and let him mix Healing Powder for you. <strong>Klamath:</strong> You can kill the rat king and protect the brahmin. You can get <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>. <strong>Toxic Caves:</strong> You need Mentats to put it on on your world map, but you can rescue Smiley once you do and get the Gecko Skinning perk. <strong>The Den:</strong> You can lay Anna to rest if you kill Joey for the locket. You can find <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>, but you need to kill the slavers to get him in your party (and Vault City on your map) and you may find it difficult to do that early on. You can become a Slaver. You can collect Rebecca's reward for killing Metzger. <strong>Modoc/Ghost Farm:</strong> You can do the first two Slag quests, guard Grisham's brahmin and clean out Farrel's garden. <strong>Vault City:</strong> You can get the autodoc perk. You can give the doll to Curtis. You can visit the vault and get the travel log. <strong>Gecko:</strong> You can't do anything. <strong>Raiders:</strong> As normal. <strong>Broken Hills:</strong> You can arm-wrestle Francis, take the scorpion tests, relocate the plant and recover Typhon's treasure. <strong>Redding:</strong> You can't do anything. <strong>New Reno:</strong> You can recover the <a href="#car">Car</a> in a violent manner and go with the Wright children to watch the desert transaction. Male characters can box. You can become a Porn Star and paralyze Jimmy. <strong>Golgotha/Stables/Sierra Army Depot:</strong> You can't get these on your world map without Mentats. Nothing exciting going on except for calling Marjorie Reed "Delenn". <strong>NCR:</strong> You can get the zeta scan, kill Jack for Mira, guard Westin's brahmin and do Duppo's brahmin drive. You can also take the Vault 15 job. <strong>Vault 15:</strong> You can do everything except expose the spy. <strong>Vault 13:</strong> You can do everything, even get <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a>. <strong>Military Base:</strong> As normal. <strong>San Francisco:</strong> You can get the vertibird plans for the Brotherhood and get the stat improvements afterwards, get the zeta scan, kill Ken Lee for the Hubologists and rescue Suze. <strong>Navarro:</strong> Pretty much as normal, oddly enough. You can get <a href="#npcs--k9">K-9</a>. <strong>Enclave:</strong> You'll have to destroy the reactor using explosives and fight Horrigan on your own, otherwise nothing special. <strong>Special encounters:</strong> You cannot talk to Arthur, otherwise nothing special. You can get <a href="#npcs--dogmeat">Dogmeat</a>.</article><hr><article><h2 id="combat">Combat <a class="header-link" href="#combat">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>Look, causing that much destruction wasn't easy!</p><footer><cite>The Chosen One</cite></footer></blockquote><p>This is not supposed to be a be-all and end-all guide to <em>Fallout</em> tactics, just a collection of hints and comments that fit under a common heading.</p><h3 id="combat--general">General <a class="header-link" href="#combat--general">🔗</a></h3><p>You can alter combat difficulty for a single battle if you're having problems. Of course, most often you also have the option to leave and return with bigger guns and more friends.</p><p>When scouting an area before a fight you can use the A key to enter combat mode and see if there are any critters hidden behind walls or scenery. If you want to examine an obscured critter with the Awareness perk, turn on the "combat looks" option.</p><p>Every time you access your inventory during a fight to gobble Stimpaks, use as many as you think you're going to need, and also reload any readied ranged weapons by dragging ammo onto your active item slot. You can use Stimpaks or other chems on your party members or yourself from inventory using the backpack icon for a cost of 2 AP each time (so keeping such items in an active item slot is pointless). This is good to remember not least when you desperately need healing but don't have quite enough AP to view inventory.</p><p>Psycho is probably the best chem for combat since it actually protects you from damage while also possibly giving you an extra AP or two. I tend never to use any drugs myself, but if you think it'll make a difference, why not. Buffout's marginal, raising stats just isn't that good (and boosting EN doesn't even raise your Hit Points). Jet is mostly annoying because of the addiction rate and low duration, so I wouldn't bother with it.</p><p>Reload your weapon after every fight so you have a fresh clip at the start of the next. (This may seem obvious, but is easy to forget.)</p><p>The smaller your chance of hitting someone, the greater the chance of a critical failure. This applies no matter the reason your chance to hit is low (bad light, long range, aimed shot, obstructing targets etc.). So don't even try using a ranged weapon if your chance to hit is below 15%. Guns can get destroyed, and energy weapons, Flamers, Rocket Launchers and grenades can even explode in your face.</p><p>Sometimes a fleeing enemy may run off the edge of the map, or onto an exit grid. If this happens it might be possible to lure it back after combat. Move away a bit and see if the critter walks back onto the screen on its own. If it doesn't, try walking towards the spot it disappeared, since it may come running towards you when combat starts even if it was running away the moment before. Your NPCs can shoot critters that are offscreen, but then you obviously won't be able to loot their corpses.</p><p>About the only time in the game when poison becomes a problem is when you're surrounded by a bunch of floaters and/or centaurs. They'll give you a lot of poison counters even if they never penetrate your armor, and once your Poison Level reaches 100, any excess points are converted to damage at an exchange rate of two to one. In this way those floaters can hurt you quite a lot without ever scratching your skin, which is a little, well, odd, but that's how it works. Wanamingo-like aliens and centaurs in random encounters can radiate you in a similar fashion.</p><p>When using burst weapons, each bullet is treated individually when it comes to penetration, damage etc., so it's possible to fire full auto and not do very much damage against an armored opponent. (Try the 10mm SMG on the aliens in Redding and you'll see what I mean.) This also makes the perk Bonus Ranged Damage more useful, but Living Anatomy does <em>not</em> add damage to each bullet.</p><p>An important note on ammo: due to poor item design, AP (armor piercing) ammo does not really do what you'd expect it to, namely pierce armor. This is because a) the modification to Damage Resistance does not nearly compensate for the much lower base damage, and b) it does not modify Damage Threshold at all. Hence in virtually any situation you're better off using JHP ammo for greater damage. Might as well make it a rule of thumb to sell off all kinds of AP ammo if you have the other type available (HN AP Needler Cartridges and AP Rockets being exceptions). Or just store it forever in the trunk.</p><p>Basic rule: when comparing two guns, look at the ammo modifiers, especially the damage multiplier, and not just the weapon damage - check out the table in Items. Also consider rate of fire if applicable, and range if you're the sniping kind.</p><p>Ammo weight is based upon how many rounds make up one ammo "item". For instance, 1-24 10mm JHP bullets will weigh 1 pound, 25-48 will weigh 2 pounds, and so on. Any amount of ammo in a weapon always counts as one item; it is for this reason the total weight carried may go up as you reload a weapon. Always unload guns that you pick up as loot, since you're usually keeping the ammo and selling the gun anyway.</p><p>If it's not completely obvious, you can unload weapons in shops and trade for the ammo.</p><p>Before getting into a fight with initially non-hostile people, you can of course use Steal to relieve them of any chems, Stimpaks, extra ammo or even guns. Personally I don't use Steal overmuch so I wouldn't bother with this either.</p><p>If you knock someone unconscious, they won't necessarily be hostile when they wake up (depends on their script). You can use this to knock someone down and take their equipment if you hadn't planned to kill them. Also people won't always be hostile if you run to an exit grid and then come back. In many townships, however, just attacking someone turns everyone permanently hostile.</p><p>Your chance to hit increases by 40% against an opponent that's lying down. You'll probably want to take the opportunity to make a called attack or two.</p><p>melee attacks give a +5% bonus to your Critical Chance.</p><h3 id="combat--tactics-and-party-management">Tactics and party management <a class="header-link" href="#combat--tactics-and-party-management">🔗</a></h3><p>As was explained in the Toxic Caves section, holding the A key as the game is loading a new area will let you get a jump on opponents. You can also open a door to a room with monsters and hit A (or click your active weapon slot) while the door opens, thus getting the first shot.</p><p>Take advantage of AI "features". For instance, critters will always react upon seeing you, not your party members (simply because they're scripted that way), and will try to attack you first. Normally they won't attack your NPCs unless they receive significantly more damage from them than from you. If you move out of the way of enemies with ranged weapons they will come running to catch up with you, giving your party members free shots at them. Sometimes critters ignore your NPCs completely, and you can then run back and forth while your comrades fire at the luckless monsters.</p><p>In a difficult battle against many enemies, make sure your party stays together. If you kill all foes in one room, for instance, an NPC on the "on your own" setting will happily charge into the next by themselves even if that means exposure to massive fire. To prevent this you should put them on "stay close to me" or "stay where you are", so that you can pick off the opposition as they come to you and not the other way around. Bottlenecks are key tactical features on any map.</p><p>In preparation for some battles you can separate the enemy forces into smaller groups by locking doors; the fight against Metzger in the Den is a good example, and you can do this when taking on the Mordino family as well. It could make a battle a whole lot easier, but on the other hand it's also kind of silly, like stealing weapons before a fight.</p><p>Duck behind walls a lot if you can, using spare Action Points. Enemies who start running will often spend all their AP for that round moving if they can, only attacking when they're right next to you even if they have ranged weapons. You can take advantage of this to snipe your opponents and leading them on for as long as possible. Using a single AP you may be able to force the opposition to waste an entire turn.</p><p>If you practice aimed shots you can take advantage of an AI oddity. Many critters will turn and run if you cripple their legs (which aren't too difficult to hit), despite the fact that running is probably the one thing they've suddenly become much worse at. This effectively renders them completely harmless. For robots the tender spot is the sensors. People with rifles or big guns should be shot in the arm.</p><p>Your NPCs will never switch targets during a round. If you try to finish off weak opponents you reduce the risk of your NPCs "wasting" a shot.</p><p>Be careful about giving burst weapons to certain trigger-happy party members (<a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> and <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>). While NPCs will try to avoid burst-firing you, they'll sometimes do it to other party members, and they'll also do it more often if you have full HP and good armor (i.e. they think you can take it). A good way to counter this is to equip them with single shot weapons (Sniper Rifle, .233 Pistol, Gauss Rifle, Turbo Plasma Rifle). This way they also won't waste ammo by burst-firing a target across the whole screen.</p><p>You may want to avoid putting certain melee weapons on your NPCs altogether (e.g., spears or sledgehammers on <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, knives on <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a>), because sometimes when they don't have enough AP for a ranged attack they'll equip the melee weapon and not switch back on their own, which is a) bad, and b) damn annoying. On the other hand, you might want a Super Sledge on <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> in case he runs out of ammo for his favorite SMG. Or just make sure he doesn't. Note: you can sometimes use combat settings to prevent this, e.g., you can put <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> on ranged only, but not <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>.</p><p>Take your own and everyone else's favorite mode of combat into account when designing tactics for your team. If you and <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> are going to charge into close combat, it's not a very good thing to have <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a> standing behind you with a Bozar or Rocket Launcher. Single shot weapons will work fine, though, i.e. Turbo Plasma Rifle on <a href="#npcs--marcus">Marcus</a>, Gauss Rifles or Sniper Rifles for you, <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> and <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a>.</p><p>Always take out enemies armed with Rocket Launchers or Grenades first, especially if you're in a tight formation with party members. This goes for super mutants as well as rocket-packing robots. May depend on your armor, though; with Advanced Power Armor on you might be more concerned with the potential critical hits of Gauss Rifles and Laser Rifles.</p><p>If you're playing HtH, you're probably going to end up chasing a lot of runners. One way of catching up is to end combat if possible and then sneak up on them. Another is to let your NPCs do the chasing since critters will only run from you and not them; but this doesn't work if your NPCs are on the "stay close to me" setting. Yet another way is to bring a gun for this purpose.</p><p>It seems to me that NPCs equipped with HtH weapons tend to "sleep" more, i.e. stand idle even if there's an enemy right in front of them, and use Stimpaks less, even if they're mortally wounded. To some extent (but not all) this may be caused by a combination of combat settings. You'll have to decide if you want to give them more freedom to move around and pick their targets, or if you want to keep them close. It also seems that one or more NPCs armed with ranged weapons can help them "wake up"; for instance, when I faced Horrigan with <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a>, <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> and <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> armed with melee weapons none of them would lift a finger to help unless I got Horrigan to shoot them by accident. However, when I switched <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> to a gun he would fire on Horrigan, and after a couple of turns of this <a href="#npcs--goris">Goris</a> and <a href="#npcs--sulik">Sulik</a> joined in as well.</p><h3 id="combat--suggested-weapon-progression">Suggested weapon progressions <a class="header-link" href="#combat--suggested-weapon-progression">🔗</a></h3><p>There are lots of weapons in <em>Fallout 2</em>, many of which you'll probably never use. Whoever stormed their enemies wielding a Club or a Sawed-Off Shotgun? Yet there are still enough choices that the optimal weapon progression can't be summarized in two paragraphs like in the <em>Fallout</em> guide. A few things might be noted in advance. One is that I'm assuming you play the areas in the "proper" order. Not every weapon deserves a mention; some weapons I'll just skip because they suck (Rocks), others because they appear when you already have better alternatives ("Little Jesus").</p><p>The beginning is pretty uncomplicated. You start out with a Spear, which can shortly be upgraded to a Sharpened Spear. Unless you tagged Melee Weapons your Unarmed skill will be slightly higher, which will give you increased speed and chance to hit at the cost of some damage while battling ants and geckos.</p><p>Decent early Melee Weapons include the Sharpened Spear which has good damage and a 2-hex range, and the Combat Knife (buy or find in Klamath) which has a lower AP cost. Weapon progression for HtH characters is slower and jerkier than for ranged weapons, so you'll probably have to make do with these for quite a while. You may be able to get hold of a Cattle Prod relatively early, but you'll be hard pressed to find enough ammo.</p><p>One way of getting a good weapon quickly (that has a low AP cost and doesn't require ammo) is to go to New Reno and finish Mrs Wright's quest for the Louisville Slugger. The Wakizashi Blade found in the vicinity is also a step up from the Combat Knife, and though it doesn't compare to the Slugger it's an option if you want a cool weapon early on but feel strongly about stupid shortcut techniques.</p><p>If you arrive in NCR before taking on the New Reno quests, you can get yourself a Ripper. Not worth it if you have or are soon getting the Slugger, though, or if you've upgraded that old Cattle Prod (which is still slightly inferior to the Louisville Slugger, may depend on your AP). The Super Sledge, available in SF or from Eldridge once you become a Made Man, is of course the end of the Melee Weapons progression, but by that time you may find yourself tempted to switch to Unarmed anyway. I'd recommend that you wait until you get the training in San Francisco before building Unarmed, but once done it will probably make your game a little smoother since the Mega Power Fist doesn't have the knockback effect.</p><p>For Unarmed weapons, you can steal Spiked Knuckles from the Duntons in Klamath, then nothing, then nothing, then once you get to Broken Hills or NCR you can get the upgradable Power Fist. Hopefully you can also trade for all the Small Energy Cell you need in NCR by then. The Mega Power Fist represents the end of this progression and requires only a quick trip to New Reno (though a stupid character would have to buy it in SF). By this time you also have a few fancy special kicks and punches, but if you look at their AP cost they're just not that attractive compared to the Power Fist.</p><p>Now for guns. Guns are more fun. Really! It starts out with the Pipe Rifle (if only because you get it for free in Klamath), which is good for rat hunting in Trapper Town but not much more. Since you have to reload it for each shot its AP cost is basically equivalent to 7, which is not so good. Still, it's your first firearm. The 10mm Pistol which can be bought or found in Klamath is quite wonderful in comparison.</p><p>Once you get to the Den there are a few more alternatives, notably the Hunting Rifle, the 10mm SMG (buy from Tubby, or wait until you can get it for free in VC) and the .44 Magnum Revolver (buy from Flick, or from Harry in VC). The latter is a personal favorite of mine in the early mid-game: the AP cost and damage make it superior to all other handguns except the .223 Pistol, and it has a lovely "blam" firing sound. That it can be upgraded (which increases its range as well) is just icing on the cake. With the Sniper perk and a Luck of 9-10, the .44 Magnum becomes a lethal weapon against any foe (but then again, so does everything else). Of the two types of .44 ammo, FMJ is marginally better unless you count on getting lots of no-armor criticals, in which case the JHP delivers more raw damage.</p><p>The 10mm SMG, on the other hand, is your first burst-fire weapon, but you may not have too much ammo for it before you kill Metzger's bunch in the Den. Well, not much to fight until after Gecko, anyway. Advanced shotguns or other burst-fire weapons are probably the way to go after that. The first one available is the Combat Shotgun in Vault City. You'll probably only use the H&K CAWS if you find it in a random encounter; it fires more bullets in each burst, but you have to reload it after two bursts. The Pancor Jackhammer from NCR is the best shotgun in the game, but has a few SMG rivals to contend with in the late mid-game.</p><p>The "Grease Gun" which can be bought in New Reno is superior to other early burst weapons (such as the largely uninteresting FN FAL) by virtue of its AP cost, but cannot measure up to later SMGs since it fires nondescript .45 Caliber. The H&K G11 from Redding is a favorite of mine. You don't have much ammo for it to begin with, but it's got a large magazine and fires reasonably small bursts. If you stop by NCR every now and then, it's not impossible to use the H&K G11 as your main weapon throughout the mid-game. If you take your time you may run into Snake Morton and get his H&K G11E. The HK P90c is comparable in power, costs 1 AP less to fire but doesn't penetrate armor as well, uses common 10mm ammo and becomes available in NCR.</p><p>I mentioned the Hunting Rifle earlier; it could be said to kick off the sniping weapon progression in the Den. You can have it upgraded cheaply in Gecko or NCR, or even get a Scoped Hunting Rifle for free in Broken Hills. The Sniper Rifle is next after that (SAD, Vault 15), having a greater range and doing more damage than the Scoped Hunting Rifle, but it has a smaller magazine and costs 1 AP more to fire. Your call.</p><p>I should probably mention the .223 Pistol again, if only because it's cool (good damage, but falls a little short of being a true sniping weapon). The Needler Pistol is comparable in range and power if you use the good ammo, which is pretty scarce however. One more freaky alternative is the Red Ryder LE BB Gun (usually found in the SAD, can also be bought in NCR), which has a good AP cost, needs hardly ever be reloaded and can be quite dangerous if you have the Sniper perk, but has rather a short range for a rifle.</p><p>Gauss weapons represent the merging of the burst and sniping paths for Small Guns. Both of them have a very long range and good armor penetration. The Gauss Rifle offers a lot of damage even without the most cruel perks in place, while the Gauss Pistol can be fired for 2 AP with Fast Shot and Bonus Rate of Fire; with the Sniper perk and 10-12 AP this means you can often knock down several tough opponents each turn. This is why you don't really need any other combat skill than Small Guns.</p><p>You won't find many big guns early on. You can find M60s in random encounters near Redding, get the Bozar from the Toxic Caves, or buy the Avenger Minigun in NCR. Against unarmored or lightly armored targets it doesn't really matter much which one of these you use, if you get to apply it up close anyway. Once you face people in power armor or tough deathclaws you'll want some stopping power, though; the Bozar and the Vindicator Minigun stand out here. The Vindicator Minigun is arguably the most devastating weapon all round, but has the downside of guzzling 4.7mm Caseless ammo which is not nearly as common as 5mm JHP for the Avenger Minigun or .223 FMJ for the Bozar. This means you probably can't use it as your main weapon for any extended period of time. Against a well-armored opponent the Avenger Minigun won't cut it because of the ammo modifiers, so you might as well go with the Bozar from the start if you like big guns.</p><p>Early Energy Weapons aren't all that good: the Plasma Pistol (Toxic Caves, SAD), for instance, is clearly inferior to the .223 Pistol, and you simply don't want to go around dispensing laser damage. The Plasma Rifle (also SAD) is OK, though, and its upgraded version with improved range and damage is quite nifty. You need ST 6 to handle it, however.</p><p>The pulse weapons normally become available after you've been to Navarro. Of these the Pulse Rifle is perhaps the most efficient, being light, having a decent range, and doing serious damage to everything except floaters. If you have Fast Shot, Bonus Rate of Fire and Sniper you can take out most enemies. While the Pulse Pistol is by no means bad, it falls short of the Gauss Pistol because of its small magazine and short range. The Alien Blaster is perhaps something of an extravaganza; it works similarly to the Pulse Pistol only its range is even shorter.</p><p>Finally the Throwing weapon progression. Ummm. Well, to begin with you have Spears (Throwing Knives cost 1 less AP to throw, but it's not worth it in terms of damage)... and the odd Molotov Cocktail. A Sharpened Spear is better than a regular Spear, of course, but you'll only have one of those. Later on you can get hold of a few Frag Grenades (kill dogs with them), even later you get Plasma Grenades (kill unarmored people with them) and Pulse Grenades for those special robot encounters. Once you feel you've got the hang of it and have managed to hoard some grenades, critters will rapidly begin to develop armor and care less and less about the deadly explosives you toss their way. Since none of the Sniper or Slayer perks applies for thrown weapons, you may as well use up your grenades early in the game (you can often hope to hit something at short range and low skill level) and prepare to switch to a decent weapon skill.</p><h3 id="combat--random-weapons-and-ammo-notes">Random weapons and ammo notes <a class="header-link" href="#combat--random-weapons-and-ammo-notes">🔗</a></h3><p>Some people advise against "wasting" ammo on the Pipe Rifle or 10mm Pistol early in the game, shooting rats and geckos and stuff. I disagree completely: Klamath and the Toxic Caves are perhaps the only places where you'll feel that using what limited resources you have makes a whole lot of a difference. After you clean out New Reno, then what will a few hundred rounds of 10mm JHP mean to you? Probably nothing, but if you spend 50 rounds in Klamath blowing away a few pesky rats, it's more than worth it for the satisfaction.</p><p>Silly note: in my first game, once I got the Assault Rifle from Vegeir, I kept and used it for a very long time simply because I thought the weapon progression was similar to that in <em>Wasteland</em>, where assault rifles were powerful. It's funny, because I <em>did</em> notice all that time that my NPCs with Combat Shotguns were inflicting much, much more damage than I was. Don't keep this weapon for longer than you have to.</p><p>Some weapons have accuracy modifiers that are independent of weapon range and ammo stats. The weapons that give a flat +20% are: 14mm Pistol, 9mm Mauser, Shotgun, Sawed-Off Shotgun, Combat Shotgun, Pancor Jackhammer, PPK12 Gauss Pistol, M72 Gauss Rifle, Alien Blaster and Solar Scorcher. A second category of weapons give a bonus equal to (PE - 2) * 8 and these include: Red Ryder LE BB Gun, Hunting Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Assault Rifle, Assault Rifle (Exp. Mag.), Minigun, Rocket Launcher, Laser Rifle, Laser Rifle (Ext. Cap.), Gatling Laser, Plasma Rifle and Turbo Plasma Rifle. Finally, the Scoped Hunting Rifle yields a bonus of (PE - 2) * 12 to hit. Note that not many weapons that weren't in <em>Fallout</em> have been given an accuracy bonus, but at least you can't lose one by upgrading something (unless you call trading in your old Minigun for the Avenger variety an upgrade).</p><p>The Scoped Hunting Rifle is very inaccurate at a range of 7 hexes or less (which is a little odd, I mean, if they're right in front of you, why not just ignore the scope?), but can be a wonderful implement for picking people off from across the whole screen. The Sniper Rifle, on the other hand, works just fine at short range.</p><p>2mm EC ammo for the gauss weapons is often regarded as "rare". I have so far never experienced this and quite happily give Gauss Rifles to both <a href="#npcs--vic">Vic</a> and <a href="#npcs--cassidy">Cassidy</a> in the late game. Although two shops in VC and NCR are the only ones which provide 2mm EC on a regular basis, the fact that you only use them for single shot attacks makes up for this. I usually end up with thousands of 2mm EC rounds in my trunk just like every other ammo type (before going to the Enclave). If you need more, fight an Enclave patrol (which will also net you extremely valuable weaponry).</p><p>If you're adept at both Melee Weapons and a ranged weapon skill, a good late-game combination is to keep the Super Sledge in one item slot and a ranged weapon (like the Gauss Pistol) in the other. This way you can knock them back then fire at them mercilessly.</p><p>If you're going to use a Rocket Launcher (or any other Big Gun), it's a good idea to keep a handgun in your other active item slot, like a Gauss Pistol or upgraded .44 Magnum. You'll often find that you can't hit multiple enemies with the Rocket Launcher or a burst weapon, in which case it may be more economical to switch to the handgun and shoot a single target with that instead. Sometimes, too, the only opponents you face may be a pack of howling mantis and deploying a rocket would be your last resort. Lastly, it may well help you get the most out of your Action Points if you switch between a slow and a fast weapon in a round.</p><p>Although floaters as noted have a high resistance to electrical damage, they and aliens are rather vulnerable to fire damage. It's pretty unlikely you'd choose to lug a Flamethrower around just for this, though. Small tough deathclaws are most vulnerable to plasma damage, while large ones are sensitive to laser damage for some reason. Frank Horrigan carries armor that's even tougher than Adv. Power Armor MKII, but is vulnerable to electrical damage (so the Pulse Rifle works fine on him). (One might think that Horrigan and Enclave soldiers would be partially vulnerable to EMP damage, but this is not the case.) The vorpal rat and bridgekeeper are resistant to everything.</p><p>One drawback with guns that deal electrical damage is that after your enemy dies (neat effect), they'll drop all their equipment in a heap for you to pick up one item at a time instead of using the handy "take all" button. Also this makes it easier for items to become lost behind opaque scenery. Very, very annoying, but if you put the violence level down to normal, your victims will char but not disintegrate.</p><p>It seems likely that the M60 and Bozar have had their firing sounds inadvertently exchanged. The M60, which has a "blam" sound in the game, is of course a machine gun, while the Bozar, which has a "rotating barrels" sound like a Gatling, is a kind of sniper rifle according to the description and picture and uses accurate .223 FMJ ammo.</p><p>The AC modifier for Rocket AP should probably have belonged to Explosive Rocket instead (to simulate its "splash damage", whereas an AP rocket must hit its target directly to be fully effective). As it is, Rocket AP is strictly superior.</p><p>What the FN FAL (Night Sight) does is completely remove darkness modifiers. This only has any significant effect if you're sniping from long range, and it's not worth it anyway - the Hunting Rifle is still vastly superior in darkness because of its ammo and accuracy modifiers.</p><p>Some weapons have special "item perks" that presumably improve their performance (the innate accuracy modifiers are of this origin). In some cases the effect is obvious, in others it's more subtle. The Improved Flamer has Flameboy, whatever that means - judging by the item description it's possible the Improved Flamer and the Flamethrower Fuel MKII were meant exclusively for each other, in which case the weapon itself may have no special properties. Sledgehammer, Super Sledge, Louisville Slugger and (Plated) Boxing Gloves (when you're not in the ring) have Knockback. The .44 Magnum (Speed Load) has Fast Reload (gasp). Magneto-Laser Pistol, Ripper, (Mega) Power Fist, .223 Pistol, Claws, Needler Pistol, pulse weapons, Holy Hand Grenade, Wakizashi Blade, "Little Jesus" and End Boss Knife all have Penetrate, which may reduce armor modifiers. The (Super) Cattle Prod and Flare have the Accurate perk which means they grant a +20% to hit bonus. The FN FAL (Night Sight) has, unsurprisingly, the Night Sight perk.</p><p>The Sawed-Off Shotgun counts as a one-handed weapon, while the Louisville Slugger, H&K G11 and H&K G11E count as two-handed. This is not obvious from the animations used, so it might be good to know if you're using the One Hander trait.</p><p>Here is the deal with Flares: 1) When dropped on the ground in multiples their light effect is cumulative, increasing the radius of the bright spot. 2) When thrown, they are automatically lit if it's dark; this is determined by the map's overall light level. 3) When lit, a Flare burns for two hours and then disappears. 4) Making aimed throws with Flares doesn't increase the AP cost, which is 1. 5) Flares tossed at people in power armor may cause blindness, loss of consciousness, crooked limbs or death pretty much like bullets do, and arguably they are more humiliating. Better Criticals and Living Anatomy are highly recommended. Filip Stefanak argues that this goes a long way towards redeeming the Throwing skill, but at the same time it's a bit cheesy. 6) If a stack of Flares is used on a piece of scenery or on a critter, all of them but one will turn into eternally lit Flares, which can be thrown, reused and sold. This is a bug.</p></article><hr><article><h2 id="items">Items <a class="header-link" href="#items">🔗</a></h2><blockquote><p>What do I WANT? I don't really know.

EMP is presumably only used for Pulse Grenades and everyone but robots has a very high resistance level (for the player character that resistance is actually part of the armor definitions, so a "naked" character has no such resistance!). Electrical damage is used for pulse guns, the Alien Blaster, (Super) Cattle Prods and some traps and similar hazards. As a rule of thumb, electrical resistances are the same as plasma.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The two types of Power Armor raise your ST by 3 to a maximum of 10. The two types of Advanced Power Armor raise your ST by 4.</p></aside><h3 id="items--weapons">Weapons <a class="header-link" href="#items--weapons">🔗</a></h3><div

It functions as an Unarmed weapon and adds your Melee Damage to the maximum damage although this doesn't show in the inventory window (the latter goes for Spears etc. as well when not thrown).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>A lit Flare has the exact same properties as an unlit Flare.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Pulse Grenade, being the only weapon that inflicts EMP damage, does no damage to non-robot critters, but it can do a lot of damage to <em>you</em> unless you're wearing any kind of armor. I always suspected the Chosen One to be an android. (This is actually because the main character uniquely has the EMP DR as part of the armor item definitions instead of the critter definition.) You can inflict lethal critical hits on living targets with Pulse Grenades, but unless you have the Living Anatomy perk this will cause a bug (see the Toxic Caves section) and will generally be unwanted.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Solar Scorcher doesn't need ammo to reload, but you can only do so in bright light. This is determined by the map's overall light level, not by the time of day or the light level where you are standing; basically if you can see the spotlight around your character, it's too dark. This means that on some indoor maps like fully lit vaults you can always reload the Scorcher, while on others like the first floor of the Bishop or Mordino casino you never can - unless you have Night Vision, which affects the overall light level directly. The Scorcher deals laser damage, so it's not all that good. I would assume that ammo modifiers all default to zero in this case.</p></aside><aside class="red"><p>For punch and kick attacks, refer to the manual where they are described in detail. They don't go in the table since they're not items.</p></aside><h3 id="items--ammo">Ammo <a class="header-link" href="#items--ammo">🔗</a></h3><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th

specified. (Duration given for Healing Powder and Mutated Toe is for the stat penalty only.) The effect of Psycho and Rad-X wears off by one half at a time. You cannot benefit from using more than two doses of a specific chem at the same time, but additional doses can cause addiction. Stats raised by chems will drop below their original values for a period of time after the effect wears off, about as much as the initial bonus. RadAway takes full effect over the course of 4 hours. Antidote takes full effect over the course of 2 minutes.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Books raise a skill by a number depending on your current skill level, ranging from 6-7 at low skill levels (20-30%) to 1-2 (70-90%). You get twice that amount if the skill is tagged. This stops at 91% (or 92% if you raise a tagged skill from 90%). Reading a book takes from 1 to 10 hours depending on your Intelligence (i.e. 11-IN).</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Geoffrey Bateman adds on book reading: "You know you can drop your stats in various ways (booze, drugs)? And of course, the skills associated with those stats drop, too. Well, not only will using manuals while your skills are lowered make them more effective, the game also applies the 91% cap to your artifically lowered skill percentage. Then when your stats go back to normal you keep the extra points." In theory you can raise Small Guns, First Aid and Science to 127%, Repair to 118% and Outdoorsman to 115% using this technique, providing that your PE, IN and AG are at 10, your EN is above 3, and all the relevant skills are at 91%. To lose 9 AG, use 2 Buffout, rest 5 hours, use 2 Monument Chunk, then rest 1 hour. To lose 9 IN, use 2 Mentats, rest 24 hours, then use 2 Psycho. To lose 9 PE, drink lots of alcohol. To lose 3 EN, use 2 Buffout, rest 6 hours, use 1 Buffout, then rest 6 hours. "Also, make sure you use all your books from the inventory screen rather than a weapon slot; time won't pass until you close it, so you don't have to worry about your stats coming back before you're done. I also suspect that this would work when using skill points (once you get to the point where it costs more than one to upgrade, obviously)." Yep, it does.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can play with the difficulty level in a similar manner to get more out of reading books (except Guns and Bullets). Turning the difficulty from easy to normal lowers all non-combat skills by 20%; changing it from normal to hard lowers them by another 10%. You can then read books to get the skills back to 91%, and finally turn difficulty back to normal. Note that if you want to combine this with the drug technique descibed above, you'll have to do them at the same time to maximize your gain.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can use alcoholic drinks on people in case you don't want them to shoot straight once you attack them, or if you want to lower their PE before a Sneak or Steal attempt. I haven't noticed any significant difference in combat when I've tried this, but you can use it to interfere with certain scripts (e.g., people guarding doors like Keith Wright). Beer and Booze also cause cows to fall over, but the usefulness of this is limited.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The Jet Antidote is bugged so that it is not used up if you're addicted to Jet when you use it, but I'm putting it in this category anyway. A method to exploit this is described in the Vault City section.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You can get around the 2-dose limit for chems by saving and loading; the game then won't stop you from taking two more with the usual effects. Among other things it'll help with the book trick described above, but it's obviously a form of bug exploitation.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You cannot kill anyone directly by reducing their Maximum Hit Points to 0 using Mutated Toes. However, if you hit someone who's had Toes used on them, they'll drop to their new maximum at least. If this is 0 they won't die, but if you then look at them, they'll lose their red outline and will be described as dead. You can't talk to them in this state, but you can finish them off.</p></aside><h3 id="items--items-which-have-general-use-may-also-have-quest-use">Items which have general use (may also have quest

lets you keep items that are really supposed to disappear from your inventory, depending on which script command is being used to remove them. Items are "protected" if they're below the Bag in your inventory, apparently because the engine can't handle the container item type properly. Ways you can exploit this include giving Cornelius' watch to both him and Farrel and get xp for both those quests, getting upgraded weapons from Algernon or Skeeter while keeping the originals, and having <a href="#npcs--myron">Myron</a> concoct any number of Stimpaks or Super Stimpaks from the same ingredients. If you like to carry the Bag around but don't like to cheat, make sure the Bag is always near the bottom of your inventory, or make sure to relocate ingredients and weapons to the top before making chems, upgrades etc. The bug doesn't affect money or items kept in the Bag. Finally an observation from Sean Meskill regarding Algernon: "When I requested the fuel upgrade, I had a pack of 5 fuel units under my Bag. When I got my upgrade, I had a pack of 10 blue fuel above and a pack of 10 red fuel beneath."</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The four medical supplies items will vanish after use if you fail a separate skill check. Applying them to a healthy subject will cause time to pass and they may be used up. Finally, the Paramedics Bag appears to be bugged; at any rate it doesn't provide a skill bonus to normal healing.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>The bonuses of items such as Lockpicks and Tools vary between scripts. Though they are usually +20% and +40% respectively, they might be +10% and +50% in one script while another treats them alike. All normal doors have the +20%/+40% bonuses anyway. Also not all scripts will allow you to substitute either or both bonus items for using the actual skill. The Super Tool Kit in particular is used in so few scripts that I'd settle for a Tool if anything.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Geiger Counters and Motion Sensors use up "charges" each time you turn them on, but don't seem to care much about how long you leave them on after that (the Geiger Counter will lose a charge if you leave it on and rest for several days). They'll turn off automatically if you move to another map.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>You'll find there's a bartering bug related to Geiger Counters: some of them cannot be bartered away no matter what kind of offer you make although they have a cash value displayed in the bartering interface as usual (kind of like trying to sell armed Dynamite or a lit Flare). It could have to do with the fact that traders will refuse to accept Geiger Counters whose batteries have run out, although this bug affects items with charges as well, and you can always sell Motion Sensors even if they don't have any charges.</p></aside><aside class="green"><p>Although there are two Mirrored Shades in the game, you can only benefit from wearing one pair, which sort of makes sense.</p></aside><h3 id="items--items-which-have-one-time-or-one-place-use-unless-otherwise-noted">Items which have one-time or one-place use (unless otherwise noted) <a class="header-link"

The number of items in question includes what you and your NPCs are carrying, the items on critters and in containers on the map (including shops), plus the stuff in your <a href="#car">Car</a> no matter if it's present or not. The bug triggers upon leaving an area, and means that next time you try to enter that map, your computer will lock up completely. Many people have reported this behaviour; you'll notice how the "orbiting rocket" mouse pointer shows up on the screen, but doesn't animate. The hard drive might buzz for a while then fall silent. Depending on your system you may have to turn your computer off entirely. If you reload the game the same thing will happen again eventually, or right away if the save includes the broken state of the map you're trying to enter (but since a map goes bad only when you leave it, the current map of each save will never be corrupted, thankfully). Maps will become corrupted more frequently as you continue to play and amass items, making the game nearly (or literally) unplayable towards the end.</p><p>The simplest way to prevent this from happening is to avoid carrying around quest items which you have no further use of. If you want to keep them, don't store them in your trunk but in some accessible container on a map where there are no shops, or where there are not too many items anyway. If you want to be doubly safe, avoid selling too many different items in one place. If you're not in the habit of hoarding items, this will probably not be an issue.</p><p>If a map in a saved game has been corrupted, there is no way (known to me, at least) to restore it, but you can work around the problem. What you must do is find the corresponding file from an earlier save and replace the bad file with it. For instance, San Francisco Chinatown, which is the map where this might well happen to you the first time (two big shops), is "sfchina.sav" - use the <kbd>Ctrl-R</kbd> trick to find the right map if you're in doubt. Critters and items on the map will revert to what they were in the previous save, and local variables may change (possibly interfering with dialogue or allowing you to repeat certain actions), but global variables such as quest status as well as the contents of your <a href="#car">Car</a> are stored elsewhere and so are not affected. NPCs (including the trunk) left standing on the broken map will only be present if they were in the save you got the replacement file from. (You may also on the "fixed" map encounter duplicates of party members left behind elsewhere, and you can kill these and take any stuff that the real NPC was carrying, but this would be cheating.)</p><p>At this time it's not perfectly clear which circumstances lead up to the freezing bug. It's been theorized that having too many Pip-Boy files in your status screen could be the cause of the bug, since it can lead to the "black button" bug and would be consistent with the fact that it strikes after visiting the Military Base with its holodisks. It's also possible that there are multiple causes for the black button bug (which has even been observed in the original <em>Fallout</em> as a result of excessive item hoarding), but that only in the "too many items" case does it go on to the freezing bug; to my knowledge there are no reports to the contrary.</p><aside class="yellow"><p>Daniel Valle may have found a way to circumvent the problem based on the theory that the corruption bug only follows the black button bug: "I noticed that the skilldex button going black happened <em>only</em> after I opened the Pip-Boy and checked out the status screen to see my missions and logs. Opening the Pip-Boy's primary screen or alarm clock did not cause this. My solution has been to not look at the status screen. If I really had to do so, I would quicksave and check it out, then I'd have to shut down the game and start it up again, because once the skilldex button's gone black it will stay black, even if you load save games from Arroyo, which could possibly corrupt maps even early on in the game. So far it has worked well on two games I have already beat and one I am still playing. Truly, I don't know what triggers the problem or its true cause, but if this keeps the game from locking up and corrupting maps then it will have to do." Nimrod adds to this: "I tend to travel light and not hoard items, but I can say with sureness that the evil number of Pip-Boy entries is twelve. I've paid close attention to this in <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Fallout 2</em> and it's the same number in both - eleven is fine, twelve and you instantly hit problems. I should note that I've never had a map crash on me due to this problem, but I get all the black boxes where buttons should be."</p></aside><h3 id="addenda--unfinished-business">Unfinished business <a class="header-link" href="#addenda--unfinished-business">🔗</a></h3><p>You may think <em>Fallout 2</em> is a big enough game as it is, but the designers were aiming to make it even bigger. There are lots and lots of things, great and small, that didn't make it into the final product, and in many places it shows in different ways. Such things that had to be omitted may include, but are probably not at all limited to the stuff listed here, some of which has been mentioned in the walkthrough. (One or two of these may just be rumours, though.)</p><ul><li>An additional twist to the Lynette-Westin holodisk exchange where the player could blackmail them with knowledge of their underhanded connection.</li><li>A good ending for Vault City and Gecko; well, actually two endings, one for each town. The good ending for Gecko which revolves around Gordon's "greed is good" scheme is only inaccessible because of a bug.</li><li>Two VC endings where Vault City is razed and one Gecko ending where Vault City invades Gecko.</li><li>One Broken Hills subplot with Chad the corrupt caravan leader and another concerning the mutagenic serum.</li><li>A few extra movies (e.g., meeting Gruthar, the desert transaction and getting the <a href="#car">Car</a>).</li></ul><h3 id="addenda--note-on-guide-translation">Note on guide translation <a class="header-link" href="#addenda--note-on-guide-translation">🔗</a></h3><p>Since putting out version 1.1 I've been asked by a few people if it's OK for them to translate the guide into other languages, something which would seem to testify to the level of devotion inspired by this game. At the time of writing translations into Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian <em>and</em> European), German, French, Spanish, Slovak, Russian, Finnish and Italian should be planned, under way or finished, and there is also a Chinese adaptation of some sort.</p><p>If anyone wants to take on the task of translating the guide, feel free to do so! (Of course, it might be a good idea to drop me a mail in case someone else is already on the job, or just to say hi.) My one condition is that you respect the fact that this is originally my work, which means you should not make arbitrary changes, forget to credit me, or try to make money out of it. Here are a few guidelines:</p><ul><li>I would prefer that you keep the original HTML format and presentation style, although if you desperately want to convert the guide into Word format, RTF, pure text or PDF I won't tell you no.</li><li>Please stay as faithful to the original as possible, meaning you shouldn't omit or move about paragraphs or information, work your own opinions into the text, or make "updates" of your own without clearly labelling them as such. Obviously you should feel free to make cosmetic changes, e.g., omit puns that wouldn't make sense in translation or modify and rearrange sentences as dictated by style or grammar.</li><li>Add a translation credit at the top of the guide.</li><li>Optionally add a "Translator's note" subsection in Addenda above the version history.</li><li>Add something distinguishing to the version designation at the top and insert this in the version list, e.g., "V1.3No" if you were translating it into Norwegian. If the number of translations continues to grow, you may have to use more than just one or two letters to avoid ambiguity.</li><li>Include your email address somewhere (translator's note, version list, or the copyright notice).</li></ul><p>For users of translated versions, please note that I cannot answer any questions about them, react to language-specific error reports, or otherwise act as a go-between. You'll have to direct your queries to the translators, or consult the original. Also any feedback in languages other than Swedish or English will be pretty much wasted on me. 🙂</p></article><hr><footer><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements <a class="header-link" href="#acknowledgements">🔗</a></h3><ul><li>Without the use of Per's Fallout 2 walkthrough, I would not have been able to pinpoint the majority of the bugs fixed in my patch.
