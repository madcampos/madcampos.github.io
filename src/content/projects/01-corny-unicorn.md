A unicorn adoption website project for [Toronto JS'](https://torontojs.com) Code club event.

It uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/) as the backend, with an SQLite database. For the frontend, it uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project is a work in progress and is being used to help new developers learn how to create a website from scratch.

We are building it step by step, starting with the interface and then adding the data to it.
