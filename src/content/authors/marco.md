Marco is a Senior web developer with over 10 years of experience, ranging from front-end to back-end development, and as he likes to put it: "When I started layouts were done with tables and Flash was still a thing."

He has a passion for accessibility and PWAs and loves to teach and share his knowledge with others.

He strongly believe that technology and specially the web should be open and available to eveyone, and that's why he's always looking for ways to make the web a better place and contribute to open source projects.
