While building this blog I included one of my favourite yet underrated features: [RSS feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/) ([RSS Specification](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification)) support.

While RSS feeds are old and I feel like a boomer to use it, they are a nice way to consume content _directly_ from the source. No ads, no tracking, no selling your soul to the [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) overlords.

## The Trigger

The other day I was reading a newsletter and stumbled upon [this post by Darek Key](https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/). It is an interesting read that shows how to style XML feeds using CSS.

Actually, there is a little more to it...

## Arcane XML Incantations

The way the styling of a RSS feed is done is first through a [XSLT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT) file. This file is a XML file that contains the instructions to transform the XML feed into HTML. _Then_ it has structure and can be styled with CSS.

## XSLT Transformations

The core idea behind XSLT transformations is to map an input XML file to some output, it can do things like:
- [For loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/for-each)
- [If statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/if)
- [Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/variable)
- [Built-in functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions)

Basically, what every modern developer wants from a templating language. The drawback is: it is cumbersome and weird to write.

Here is an example of the link with a logo image on the header:
```xml
<a id="logo">
	<xsl:attribute name="href">
		<xsl:value-of select="/rss/channel/link"/>
	</xsl:attribute>
	<img>
		<xsl:attribute name="src">
			<xsl:value-of select="/rss/channel/image/url"/>
		</xsl:attribute>
		<xsl:attribute name="alt">
			<xsl:value-of select="/rss/channel/image/title"/>
		</xsl:attribute>
	</img>
</a>
```

Which outputs:
```html
<a id="logo" href="https://madcampos.dev/blog/">
	<img src="https://madcampos.dev/icons/transparent/manifest-icon-512.png" alt="Marco Campos' Blog">
</a>
```

## The Verdict

It is cool that we can do something like this and it Just Works™ in browsers. But it is not something I would use to build the core of my website.
