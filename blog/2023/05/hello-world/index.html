at least the first iteration of it. So please ride along on this journey of sweet success and sorrowful cryptic error messages.<br>But first let me vent out on my frustrations on modern front-end tooling…</p><h2 id="rant">#rant</h2><p>I know that vite is amazing. It helps in getting a nice and optimized project all the way and having a “no build” development environment is really refreshing and is lovely to work on. <em>However</em>, I still hate that I’m required to have a build step when generating my files. That <em>is</em> a good idea for big projects full of small files and libraries but I’d still like to have the option to opt out of bundling just to have a website that is readable <em>by people</em> and a good place to learn even though it is not as optimal. I hate to be locked in and have to go out of my way to deal with <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a> (or <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>) shenanigans instead of just compiling typescript and be done with it.</p><p>Okay, #rant over, back to the post.</p><h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2><p>I was talking to a friend about building in the open and decided it would be a good idea to show my skills and thought process. But first I had to decide how to get the content out and where to put it.<br>One idea was to use a hosting service like <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and hook my website to it, but I already have a static site and like to keep things as simple for people accessing it as it can be.</p><p>So, that meant:</p><ol><li>Use the existing infrastructure</li><li>No front-end frameworks (to keep things simple, it has static data only after all)</li><li>Has to integrate well with vite</li><li>I can build it myself if no tools already exist</li></ol><h2 id="the-how">The How</h2><p>My investigation began, as usual, with typing “vite blog plugin” on Bing and Google and seeing what that lead me.<br>Unfortunately there were no existing plugins for that. The only option was <a href="https://vitepress.dev/">VitePress</a>, it is a good one but when I tried it was doing too much magic and altering the existing project a lot, so not a “plugin” and more of a “full featured system built <em>on top of</em> vite”.</p><p>That meant I was about to build a plugin or at least write <em>some</em> code myself.</p><p>The investigation followed with some Multi-page application (MPA) plugins for vite. As it was born from the Vue community it’s main purpose is to build Single-page applications (SPA) and it’s not the best at building MPAs, but it can be done. The one that caught my attention was <a href="https://github.com/emosheeep/vite-plugin-virtual-mpa/"><code>vite-plugin-virtual-mpa</code></a>. I configured it, wrote a lot of code and then went to test…</p><p>BOOM! Cryptic errors showed up.</p><h2 id="the-errors">The Errors</h2><p>The error was:</p><pre class="shiki dark-plus" style="background-color: #1E1E1E" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #D4D4D4">RollupError: The &quot;fileName&quot; or &quot;name&quot; properties of emitted files must be strings that are neither absolute nor relative paths, received &lt;PATH_TO_FILE&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>I tried to investigate what was causing it, and to keep a 4 hours of frustration story short, vite uses rollup internally and to build a MPA we have to pass in the <code>input</code> configuration to it so it can find the files and build them.</p><p>The plugin was generating the files on the dev server but when it came time to build, rollup was not able to find them because they were never created <em>on disk</em>, they were only <em>virtual</em>.</p><h2 id="the-failed-attempt">The (Failed) Attempt</h2><p>I then dug into the source code for <code>vite-plugin-virtual-mpa</code> and tried to create the minimal steps to reproduce the bug.</p><p>The trial and error approach didn’t help as the problem was too intrenched in the plugin’s code and I was not able to find a way to fix it.</p><p>But after taking a step back it clicked to me:</p><blockquote><p>What if I created the files and the input configuration “by hand” and injected it on the <code>src</code> folder then let vite deal with the build part?</p></blockquote><h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2><p>This time I tried the minimal approach first to find bugs and was able to build a working version in a couple of hours. Much of the logic was reused from the plugin fix attempt, I just had to literally write the files on disc and find a way to structure the logic.</p><p>So, the “plugin” does the following steps:</p><ol><li>Walk the <code>blog</code> folder and find all the <code>.md</code> files</li><li>Extract the metadata from the files<ol><li><p>The folder name is the date</p><p>(e.g. <code>blog/2023-05-05/hello-world.md</code> is from May 5th, 2023)</p></li><li><p>The file name is the slug</p><p>(e.g. <code>blog/2023-05-05/hello-world.md</code> is <code>hello-world</code>)</p></li><li><p>The first header on the file is the title</p><pre class="shiki dark-plus" style="background-color: #1E1E1E" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #569CD6; font-weight: bold"># Hello, World!</span></span></code></pre></li><li><p>The first html comment is the metadata with some fields like <code>description</code> and <code>tags</code></p><pre class="shiki dark-plus" style="background-color: #1E1E1E" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #6A9955">&lt;!-- description: Summary of the experience and hurdles of coding this blog. --&gt;</span></span></code></pre></li></ol></li><li>Create a file structure on the <code>src</code> folder with templates for each page and the extracted metadata</li><li>Export a list of files to be injected by vite and rollup</li><li>Let vite do it’s ✨ magic ✨</li><li>Profit</li></ol><h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2><p>The result is this blog that you, dear reader, is reading right now. It is not perfect, but it is a good MVP to be up and running and improve as I go.</p><p>The code can be viewed on GitHub on the <a href="https://github.com/madcampos/madcampos.github.io/blob/main/build/blog/index.ts"><code>blog/index.ts</code></a> file.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>There are still some point to improve. The next ones I intend to tackle are the styling of the blog (it is pretty barebones right now), and pagination.<br>But those are for future posts.</p></main></article></body></html>
